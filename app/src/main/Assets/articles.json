It can sometimes feel like your baby won't accept any foods, which can cause a lot of worry in the short term (your baby not eating enough for that day) and in the long term ("what if my baby never accepts vegetables?")\"},{\"p\":\"Scientific research shows that lifelong food preferences can be affected by experiences that we have as a baby and that the period from around 6 months to around 24 months is critical for trying new textures, smells and flavours. Research also suggests that delaying the introduction of solids or restricting food textures can result in food aversions and poor oral motor development, including the development of speech.\"},{\"p\":\"Never fear! In this section we outline strategies to help you to understand and feel confident in helping your baby to learn to love a wide variety of food flavours, textures and smells.\"},{\"h2\":\"Readiness for solids\"},{\"p\":\"If your child is under 6 months of age and is pushing food away with their hands, refusing to open their mouth, thrusting food back out of their mouth or seems disinterested in food these may be signs that they are not ready to begin eating solids. Click here for more information on signs of readiness for solids.\"},{\"h3\":\"Correct texture\"},{\"p\":\"If you are following a traditional texture progressive approach with your baby, ensure that you are offering foods that are the correct texture for their developmental stage.\"},{\"h2\":\"Single food\"},{\"p\":\"It is recommended that foods are introduced individually, for example, just puréed beef on it's own or just puréed pumpkin on it's own. No spices, added sauces or other foods are recommended to be given when first introducing foods. It may seem strange to eat just one food without an accompaniment, but this is important to help your baby to learn accept each food for its own taste and mouthfeel. In addition, if your baby has a reaction to a food it will be easier to distinguish the culprit.\"},{\"h2\":\"Eating environment\"},{\"p\":\"Setting up a calm eating environment can have a big impact on your baby forming a healthy relationship with food. For more information on creating a healthy eating environment click here.\"},{\"h3\":\"Parental reactions to food\"},{\"p\":\"If your baby dislikes a food, it is recommended that you do not react to their behaviour, because giving attention to it can emphasise the behaviour and cause the baby to repeat it. \"},{\"h3\":\"Repetition\"},{\"p\":\"Trying new foods and textures is a multi-step process and your baby may need to gain 'mouth feel' for a food before they are ready to swallow it. Allow your baby to take food into their mouth and spit it out if they need to.

It can be really confusing to keep up with their nutrition needs at each stage, and it can sometimes feel like a minefield with under eating leading to deficiencies and poor growth, and overeating leading to an increased risk of disease in later life (1)(2). Confusing questions like 'when should allergens be introduced?' and 'when do I stop feeding my baby from a bottle?' or 'what should my child's first foods be?' will constantly come up and with so much conflicting information available on the internet and social media as well as differing advice from family and friends, it is hard to decipher what is scientifically correct or 'evidence based' so that you can make the right decisions for your baby.\"},{\"p\":\"And why does this matter?\"},{\"blockquote\":\"Because we are the generation who cares about the why.\"},{\"p\":\"We want to know that there is a scientific reason for why we are doing something. We won't accept kids menus that only offer chicken nuggets and chips anymore; we know how important nutrition is and we want to give our kids the best start in life that we possibly can.\"},{\"p\":\"Before writing this program we had so many parents asking for a simple but scientific guide that explains the what, when, where, why and how of infant nutrition.  \"},{\"p\":\"So we have created just that! This guide has been developed by an accredited practising dietitian (and mother) with a background in biochemistry, human biology and medical nutrition therapy and all recommendations are made using the latest scientific evidence (3).\"},{\"blockquote\":\"Most importantly we have created this guide with the goal of providing comprehensive, clear information so that you can be confident in making choices around your child's nutrition yourself.\"},{\"p\":\"This program not only includes age specific sections with sample menus, recipes, meal and snack ideas, but also an exciting section about nutrition for sleep and the role nutrition plays in helping both baby and parents to get a better nights sleep.\"},{\"p\":\"This Program is designed to complement our Sleep Programs and the feeding times in our Sleeping and Feeding Schedules. It is also a complete stand-alone Program in its own right, for those of you who are not also following our baby sleep recommendations.\"},{\"p\":\"If at any time on your baby's feeding journey you have questions or would like more guidance, you are welcome to ask for help in the Little Ones Village, found in our custom-built app. The Nutrition Village is facilitated by the author of this Program, Tara, who is available to give further advice, as are the other families using this Program, as needed.\"},{\"h2\":\"Disclaimer\"},{\"p\":\"Whilst all care and effort has been taken to provide accurate information in our products, the information is general in nature and may not be applicable for or suitable to your and/or your child's individual circumstances. It is important to understand that the information is intended as a guide only and is not intended to replace an individualized consultation with a qualified health professional. If you have any concerns about your child's health or behavior, or any questions about whether the advice contained in the Program is suitable for your baby, please consult with your qualified health professional.Please note: Health professionals (especially Dietitians) will commonly use corrected age for calculating nutrition needs until a little one is 24 months old.\"}]}",

The wheat needed sunlight, water, and soil to grow. Nutrients were added to the soil, then the wheat grew from a small plant into a large plant. When they were big enough the plants were harvested by a wheat farmer on his tractor. The plants were then dried and sent to a factory where the seeds were separated from the rest of the plant. These seeds were crushed down into a powder that we call flour. The flour was then put  into a recipe with  eggs and water which turned into a dough. This dough was rolled very thin and then cut into strips. It was then dried and sent to the supermarket. We then put it into boiling water, and wait for it to become soft and then we eat it!\"},{\"p\":\"For more ideas on how to talk to your child during mealtime, see the "Food Superpowers" PDF.\"},{\"p\":\"\"}]}",

It is not recommended to offer solids before 4 months or to wait to introduce solids until after 7 months. Click here to see signs of readiness for solids.\"},{\"h2\":\"Which is first, milk feed or solids?\"},{\"p\":\"It is recommended that milk feeds are offered before solid foods until your baby is at least 8 months of age (20). This means that you should give your baby their full regular milk feed, then when you have finished the feed, offer solids.\"},{\"h2\":\"Which foods should be introduced first?\"},{\"p\":\"It is strongly recommended that the first foods that are introduced to your baby are iron containing foods. It is also important to introduce allergen foods from 6 months.\"},{\"p\":\"For more information on iron containing foods see the Iron chart in this Program.\"},{\"p\":\"For more information on allergen foods click here.\"},{\"h2\":\"What sort of meal should I prepare for my baby?\"},{\"p\":\"It is recommended that foods are introduced individually and no spices, added sauces or other foods are mixed with them for the first few times so that little ones can become used to the individual flavour of each food. However, more than one food can be in a meal, just keep them separate from each other on the plate\"},{\"p\":\"It may seem strange to eat just one food without an accompaniment, but this is important so that your baby can learn to accept each food for its own taste and mouthfeel. \"},{\"p\":\"As your baby starts to become used to foods you can start to mix foods, for example if they have enjoyed both lamb and spinach, you can give them a lamb and spinach puree. But for the first few times a food is eaten it is recommended that it is separated from other foods on the plate.\"},{\"h2\":\"What texture should the food be?\"},{\"p\":\"The World Health Organisation recommends that from around 6 months of age babies can eat smooth and puréed foods only.\"},{\"h2\":\"How many meals per day?\"},{\"p\":\"When first starting solids, start with one meal per day and gradually increase, to approximately 2-3 meals per day (19).\"},{\"h2\":\"What if my baby does not like the food I offer?\"},{\"p\":\"Initiating solids can be a slow process and your child may need to gain 'mouth feel' for a food before they are ready to swallow it. Allow your baby to take food into their mouth and spit it out if they need to, do not let this distress you, this is part of your child experimenting with food and forming healthy eating habits.\"},{\"h2\":\"What if my baby is rejecting the spoon?\"},{\"p\":\"If you feel that your baby is rejecting the spoon, rather than the food itself, use a very clean, washed, finger to offer food for the first few times. You can also try a silicone spoon rather than a metal spoon as metal can have a metallic taste. Small spoons, specifically for babies are best, otherwise a teaspoon is also appropriate. Forks, dessert spoons, soup spoons and tablespoons are too big to fit into a baby's mouth and are therefore not appropriate.\"},{\"h3\":\"How long should each meal take?\"},{\"p\":\"It is recommended that meal time should take around 5-15 minutes for babies this age (56).\"},{\"h3\":\"How much food should I give my baby?\"},{\"p\":\"Introduce solid foods slowly. Begin with 1-2 teaspoons of food and increase this amount when you notice that your baby's appetite increases or they appear to want more (18).

Ideally vegetarian diets will include eggs and dairy products as, without meat, these will be your baby's only source of vitamin B12. Because the 6 months between introducing complementary foods and 12 months of age is so critical to your baby's growth and future health outcomes, the world health organisation recommends to give meat foods as first foods because of the high iron and zinc content and bioavailability. Please note that the author of this guide acknowledges that vegetarian diets have been strongly associated with positive health outcomes such as a decreased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adults and the reasons for vegetarianism are multifactorial. These recommendations are based on what can provide the most adequate nutrition for infants at this particular age to ensure their best growth outcomes.\"},{\"h2\":\"Vegan diets\"},{\"p\":\"Vegan diets are not usually recommended for babies due to the lower bioavailability of plant sources of iron, lower protein content and lack of vitamin B12 among other nutrients.

If naps and awake times are all spot-on as per the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule, and if your baby can self-settle (without a pacifier) at all naps and bedtime, you can rule out a daytime sleep and settling as a reason for the wakes overnight.\"},{\"p\":\"The next most common reason is that they are hungry. By 6 months old babies can be ready to start eating solid food and in particular, protein. Until they are well established on solids, they might start waking more in the night because they are genuinely hungry. \"},{\"p\":\"Milk is still the most important food for a baby until 8 months of age, however, milk is digested very quickly and doesn't sustain your baby for long periods. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"For more comprehensive advice around starting solids and baby nutrition, you'll want to get our Baby Nutrition Guide, available by clicking the link in this app!\"},{\"p\":\"If you have started solids and your baby is still waking, it is likely that you need to increase the amount or add protein at the lunch meal for a baby 6 months and older. \"},{\"p\":\"When starting solids, we recommend you start with solids at lunchtime and increase by 1 teaspoon per day until your baby is eating at least 1⁄2 a cup, then introduce dinner. Again, start with 1 teaspoon and increase to at least 1⁄2 a cup then introduce breakfast.\"},{\"p\":\"If you are using a pacifier and overnight you are resettling with a pacifier instead of feeding (if you haven't introduced solids), please be careful. A pacifier can mask the fact that your baby is actually waking because they are hungry. Because the baby sucks the pacifier, like when they are feeding, even though they may go back to sleep, their brain thinks that it's getting food. You could be resettling when actually the reason for the wake was hunger. \"},{\"p\":\"Please note: it is normal to have up to 2 wakes in the night until solids are well established (at least 1⁄2 a cup at two meals, lunch and dinner). It can also be quite normal to have one feed a night until 8 months when solids come before milk. If your baby is older than 9 months and is still waking overnight, she will be doing so out of habit and is not needing milk, exclusively breastfed or not. \"},{\"p\":\"We do not recommend doing dream feeds over 6 months as this can create habit waking or waking later in the night and also encourages them to take calories overnight instead of during the day. \"}]}",

They are a limit, not a goal. We can't tell you on a daily basis when your baby will definitely get tired because it will depend on what they have done during the day, how their night was, how their day naps have been so far. We can tell you the maximum time when all babies for that age group will get overtired. \"},{\"p\":\"Our Sleep Program differs from other programs because we offer this maximum awake time rather than an average awake time. Other programs might suggest 2 hours awake time for a 6-month-old, however, some 6-month-old babies might easily stay awake for 2.5 hours. In this example, 2 hours isn't going to work for them, and the mother will struggle to get her baby to go to sleep if their awake time is too short, or the baby will go to sleep with some active settling, but other problems will happen at different times of the day. \"},{\"p\":\"Babies vary in the scale of their sleep needs and some do need more sleep than others. This is why the awake times in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule are the maximum – your baby might need slightly less awake time than another baby of the same age. In this way, you're able to assess your own baby's individual sleep needs and tweak the times in the Schedule to suit your baby. \"},{\"p\":\"If your little one is doing slightly less awake time and slightly more nap hours than in the Schedule and still settling and napping until the normal wake-up time, that's great, and it's a sign your baby has slightly higher sleep needs. However, if your baby is doing less awake time and more nap hours than in the Schedule and waking regularly or hourly overnight; is difficult to settle to sleep; is waking early morning or only sleeping for 20-30 mins in a nap; the likely cause is they are undertired and their awake times need to be extended/naps shortened, so they consolidate their nights and naps to be longer. This can be done by stretching out their awake times by 5-10 minutes every 2 days. \"},{\"p\":\"We would not recommend doing more awake time than stated in the Schedule. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"The trap that a lot of parents will get into is thinking that their little one can only stay awake for a short time.\"},{\"p\":\"All babies have a natural dip in energy levels around the 1-1.5 hour mark of being awake. This is when many people assume their babies are tired and put them down for a sleep, only for their baby to have a tiny nap because they weren't quite tired enough to nap for longer. This energy dip is marked by your baby yawning or getting grizzly, but try and keep as close to the maximum awake time as you can. Usually changing your baby's activity will give them a second wind and get them through to their nap time - try changing their diaper, giving them some diaper-free time, taking them outside for some fresh air.\"},{\"p\":\"Some babies, when starting out on our Sleep Program, are genuinely unable to stay awake to the maximum awake time. This is common if a baby is recovering from a build-up of chronic overtiredness. If your baby goes to sleep before the scheduled nap time, let them sleep until the normal wake-up time as specified in the Schedule (i.e, their nap will be longer). You can aim to increase their awake time by 5-10 minutes every 2 days as their build-up of overtiredness decreases.\"},{\"p\":\"If however, your baby starts displaying any of the following behaviours, you'll need to scale back the nap lengths and/or increase the awake times: \"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"\\nBeing difficult to settle for naps and bedtime \\n\"},{\"3\":\"\\nNot sleeping until the nap wake time (i.e having shorter naps than the length recommended in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule) \\n\"},{\"4\":\"\\nNot sleeping for the full Lunch Nap \\n\"},{\"5\":\"\\nWaking more overnight, or more after midnight \\n\"},{\"6\":\"\\nStaying awake for periods in the night \\n\"},{\"7\":\"\\nWaking early in the morning \\n\"}]}},{\"p\":\"In regards to nap lengths, the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules can be flexible to accommodate your baby's different sleep needs. For example, you should only shorten your baby's Morning Nap length when it is beginning to impact on their Lunch Nap or night-time sleep - not just because they've reached a certain age. \"},{\"p\":\"It might take a few days of experimentation to get the right awake time vs sleep time for your baby's individual needs. \"},{\"p\":\"As your baby starts to sleep better for their naps and in the night, they will easily be able to stick to the awake times during the day.\"},{\"video\":\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312427226\"}]}",

This nap stays the same approximate time and length from newborn right through to 2.5 years old. The other naps during the day are structured around the Lunch Nap, with the goal of achieving the 2 hours (or close to) for this nap. \"},{\"p\":\"As you move through the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules, the Morning Nap slowly decreases in length nearer to 6 months and then again nearer to 12 months. This is to continue to promote a long Lunch Nap and also to allow for some more awake time in the morning, which your baby starts needing as they get older. \"},{\"p\":\"This means that you can adjust your baby's Morning Nap length as needed, to encourage a better/longer sleep at lunchtime. Gradually reducing the Morning Nap length also means that the transition to one nap, between 12-15 months, is a lot easier once the Morning Nap is simply a quick Power Nap. \"},{\"p\":\"Babies may differ slightly in the Morning Nap lengths that work best for them. One 8-month-old baby might be fine with a 30-minute Morning Nap and still do the full Lunch Nap, while another 8-month-old baby might need their Morning Nap trimmed to 20 minutes in order to do the full 2 hours at lunch.\"},{\"p\":\"You can play with the times of the Morning Nap as needed if your baby starts waking early from the Lunch Nap and you can rule out other factors such as settling issues, hunger, sleep environment. \"},{\"p\":\"By 12 months most babies will be doing no more than 15 minutes for their Morning Nap. \"},{\"p\":\"In the 3-4 and 4-6 month sections of the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule, you'll see that the nap times move by 15 minutes in each age bracket.

This is a strict 10-minute nap that bridges the gap between their normal scheduled naps if it is greater than the maximum awake time. This means your baby can last until the next naptime, so you are back on track with your nap timings for the rest of the day. Babies between 8-12 months can be stretched out to the scheduled nap times (rather than working off their awake times like when they were younger) if they woke early from the morning or Lunch Naps or you will find you reach bedtime in the evening earlier than the scheduled time in the Schedule.

    "content": "{\"contents\":[{\"p\":\"Pacifiers are great settling tools for younger babies because sucking is extremely comforting. Babies younger than 3 months will resettle between sleep cycles a lot easier than older babies and won't need the pacifier replaced every time they come out of a sleep cycle, meaning the pacifier doesn't cause much disruption to their sleep. However, once your baby is closer to 4 months (and beyond) if they are using a pacifier to go to sleep they might start needing it every time they wake between sleep cycles (45 minutes in the day and 2 hours at night). This is a lot of pacifier runs! \"},{\"p\":\"Until your baby can replace their pacifier at around 7-8 months old, they will need you to replace it for them because they are relying on the pacifier to fall asleep, so much so, that they aren't able to go back to sleep without it. \"},{\"p\":\"If your baby is not waking to have their pacifier replaced, you are fine to keep using it. However, if it becomes a sleep problem, between 3-6 months is a good age to ditch the pacifier, unless you're happy to ride it out for a few more months until your baby can put it back in themselves. \"},{\"p\":\"What we also find with using the pacifier at night, especially for younger babies, is that it can actually mask genuine hunger - the sucking tricks their brains into thinking they've been fed. This can, in itself, lead to more night waking because your baby is genuinely hungry, rather than just waking for the pacifier. \"},{\"p\":\" \"},{\"h3\":\"How Do You Get Rid of the Pacifier? \"},{\"p\":\"Firstly, you need to make sure you've got other positive sleep associations in place, such as a swaddle or baby sleeping bag, white noise, a dark room, a cuddly or comforter or even a Lulla doll. Get the Baby Sleep Shhh track going and play it very loud or use a baby Shusher to help with settling. \"},{\"p\":\"If your baby needs to wean off the swaddle, tackle the pacifier first, then wean off the swaddle after the pacifier has been successfully ditched. \"},{\"p\":\"There are two methods to get rid of the pacifier, depending on how quickly you want the pacifier gone and the level of protesting you're comfortable with. A baby over 7 months will not easily give up the pacifier and you're better to teach them to replace it themselves at this age. \"},{\"p\":\"QUICK METHOD -You will ditch the pacifier cold turkey, starting with the first nap of the day and working through the other naps and bedtime that same day. You might need to help your baby settle for their naps by patting or shushing if they're upset while they get used to not having a pacifier. \"},{\"p\":\"If they're protest crying (which they may well be - they are protesting the change), you can leave them for intervals of 6 minutes if you're comfortable with that. Make sure you set a timer and go and do something to busy yourself. If your baby is still crying after 6 minutes you can pat or cuddle to soothe them until they're calm, then try again.\"},{\"p\":\"You'll be surprised at how they can go from crying to fast asleep at about 5 mins 30 seconds! \"},{\"p\":\"Each nap you put your baby down for, use the same method (patting or shushing if they're upset) and be consistent with your approach. Every nap they will take less and less time to settle. It will take about 2-3 days to break the habit (sometimes sooner!) if you're consistent in your approach. \"},{\"p\":\"GRADUAL METHOD –Here, you will replace the pacifier with another settling tool such as patting or rocking. You will begin by settling your baby completely to sleep using your chosen method while still using the pacifier for the first 3 days. After 3 days you will put your baby down for their naps and at bedtime without the pacifier, and you will still settle them completely to sleep using your chosen settling method. \"},{\"p\":\"Once they are used to going to sleep without the pacifier, you will then work on removing the settling, by only settling to calm them rather than to put them to sleep. You can use the 6-minute method here too, as described in the previous method.\"}]}",

The reason behind this, and the reason we're different to other sleep companies in this approach, is that if the night waking is caused by a self-settling issue, once your baby is self-settling before naps and at bedtime, their night wakes should naturally diminish or disappear on their own. It is also a lot easier to be consistent with a self-settling method during the day, when everything is less confronting, than at night when you're tired and your baby is tired and it is more tempting to \\\"give up\\\".

Just like how you go to sleep at night. This means if your baby is relying on you to do something for them in order for them to fall asleep, it's not self-settling. If you have to put a pacifier in their mouth, this is technically not self-settling unless the baby can do it themselves. \"},{\"p\":\"Sleep habits are very easily formed in babies older than 3 months. The way we put our babies down to sleep, as well as the way we resettle them during naps or in the night, will dictate how they learn to go to sleep. We call these things "sleep associations"; cues or behaviours your baby associates so strongly with going to sleep that they can't sleep without them. The most common sleep associations for babies are feeding, rocking or patting to sleep or the use of a pacifier. The way babies are put to sleep at the start of a nap or at bedtime is the only way they know how to go to sleep. If they then wake at the end of a sleep cycle and that same sleep association isn't there, they will not be able to go back to sleep without it. This is why your baby may start waking every 45 minutes during the day and every 2 hours in the night and needing your help to go back to sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Sleep associations are a normal part of falling asleep. Even as adults we need something to help us fall asleep (such as a pillow and blankets). It's when these associations disrupt your baby's sleep, because they require your assistance, that it becomes a problem.

Here are our recommended items to achieve this (these things are not "compulsory" in order to successfully follow our Programs, however we have seen that they help the majority of babies!).\"},{\"h2\":\"A Dark Room\"},{\"p\":\"This can be done using blackout blinds or simply by putting a dark sheet or blanket under or over the existing curtains. You want to cover any light that might be sneaking in around the edges of the curtain. Babies do not fear the dark, in fact, like most mammals, they actually find the dark comforting, calming and safe. Do not use a nightlight either as the light can be very stimulating to babies, making it hard for them to settle or stay asleep for a long period. \"},{\"p\":\"Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary to sleep babies in daylight during the day to avoid any kind of day/night confusion. Having your baby in a good nap pattern for their day and ensuring their naps are at the right time and the right length will naturally help your baby understand the difference between day and night and consolidate their night-time sleep quicker. There are other cues to ensure no day/night confusion occurs, such as having plenty of communication during the day, making sure your baby is getting the majority of their calorie intake during the day, and light exposure during their waking hours.\"},{\"p\":\"For babies older than 3 or 4 months, napping in a bright room can contribute to catnapping in the day, which can then lead to overtiredness at bedtime. \"},{\"h2\":\"White Noise\"},{\"p\":\"This is a great, easy settling and sleep tool for young babies but it definitely also helps older babies settle and sleep for longer too. White noise not only replicates the loud whooshing sounds babies hear in the womb (sounds that are louder than a vacuum cleaner in utero), but hearing loud white noise also triggers the calming response in babies, especially if they are overtired, overstimulated or crying. White noise also disguises any noises from the household which might startle or wake a sleeping baby.\"},{\"p\":\"When babies reach around 4 months and start waking between sleep cycles, their senses fully switch on. Having white noise playing means they are hearing the same comforting sound they heard when they fell asleep and they'll find it easier to transition between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"We have a variety of white noise tracks available through iTunes, Spotify and GooglePlay, the best of which for babies under 6 months is our Baby Sleep Shhh. Experts recommend playing the white noise louder than your baby's cries (if they are crying) or as loud as a shower to encouragegood sleep. Our advice is to play it at around 60dB. We recommend using white noise until at least 1 year of age for a baby's long nap and overnight.\"},{\"h2\":\"Swaddling (for babies under 4 months)\"},{\"p\":\"Using a swaddle for babies under 4 months old is proven to help your baby settle and sleep well. Swaddling replicates the tight, confined feeling of being in the womb and ensures babies can't wake themselves up with their startle reflex. Sometimes we hear that a baby doesn't like being swaddled, but more often than not, this is simply because the swaddle isn't tight enough, the baby is already overtired or overstimulated, or they are too hot or cold. In general, babies do prefer to be swaddled. \"},{\"p\":\"By the time your baby reaches around 4 months old, they can start to be weaned off the swaddle for sleep.\"},{\"h2\":\"Baby Sleeping Bag/Sleep Sack (for babies over 4 months)\"},{\"p\":\"Often babies wake in the night or early morning due to being too cold. We can misinterpret their waking for hunger or a settling issue and end up feeding or rocking or resettling our babies, which can create a habit wake. Using a baby sleeping bag can help make sure your baby stays nice and warm all night long. We recommend sleeping bags that are made of natural fibres - cotton, wool, bamboo, merino - as these are much safer for your baby and will mean they won't overheat (a risk factor for SIDS). Avoid using polar fleece or polyester sleeping bags as these are quite dangerous. Having a room thermometer is good too, so you can make sure you are dressing baby in the right clothing for their room temperature as some babies are very sensitive to even the slightest temperature change. \"},{\"p\":\"Here is a useful clothing and temperature guide for sleeping bags: \"},{\"table\":[[\"Room Temp\",\"Winter Weight \\nMerino Bag\",\"Mid Weight \\nMerino Bag\",\"Summer Weight\\nMerino Bag\",\"Tog Rated\\nBag\"],[\"26 C/78 F\",\"\",\"\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit\",\"0.5 tog & short sleeved bodysuit\"],[\"24 C/75 F\",\"\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit\",\"1.0 tog & short sleeved bodysuit\"],[\"22 C/71 F\",\"\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit & pyjama pants\",\"\",\"1.0 tog & long sleeved bodysuit + pyjama pants\"],[\"20 C/68 F\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit & pyjamas\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit & pyjamas\",\"\",\"2.5 tog & short sleeved bodysuit + pyjamas\"],[\"18 C/64 F\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit, pyjamas and socks\",\"\",\"\",\"2.5 togLong sleeved bodysuit + pyjamas and socks\"]]},{\"h2\":\"Cuddly/Comforter\"},{\"p\":\"Having a comforter or cuddly for sleep is a great tool to encourage self-settling in your baby. If they associate the comforter with bedtime and sleep, it will work as a strong signal to your baby when it is bedtime. Choose a comforter that is age-appropriate, washable and preferably one that you can purchase two of (so you can interchange them when you need to wash one!). Keep the comforter close to you for a few days, in your bed or under your top or next to you and baby while feeding, so it absorbs your scent. Then give it to baby for every nap and at night-time. Make sure you never place objects close enough to your baby's face that they can become a suffocation hazard. \"},{\"p\":\"Remove anything from your baby's sleep environment that is not completely conducive to sleep - excessive toys and musical mobiles are often a hindrance to a baby's ability to settle. Why sleep when you have all these toys and stimulating things to look at?! \"}]}",

    "content": "{\"contents\":[{\"p\":\"Babies go through several periods in the first year where they experience \\\"sleep regressions\\\". In some cases, babies have to re-learn sleep skills due to the parts of their brain responsible for sleep changing and maturing. Other times the regressions are more to do with developments in their physical and/or social skills and around nap transitions. \"},{\"h2\":\"The 4 Month Sleep Regression\"},{\"p\":\"A baby's sleep can dramatically change around the 4-month mark. You might have had an amazing sleeping newborn and suddenly they've started waking a lot more in the night and catnapping in the day. \"},{\"p\":\"This is commonly called the 4-month sleep regression; however, it is better not to think of it as a regression but more of a maturation of your baby's neurological development. Their brains are developing and their sleep is becoming more like ours as adults. \"},{\"p\":\"An adult sleep cycle goes through periods of deep sleep and periods of REM sleep. REM sleep is a lighter sleep where we dream and are more likely to be woken if something is different or bothering us in our environment. Our deep sleep is where we are unlikely to be woken. Adult sleep cycles are about 100 minutes long, then we rouse slightly and fall back asleep again, into the next sleep cycle without even realising it.\"},{\"p\":\"Young babies are a bit different. They have periods of active sleep and periods of quiet sleep. Active sleep is what the baby enters straight after falling asleep, this is like REM sleep in adults and they can be easily woken during this time. They breath shallower, can grunt, cry out and if anything is bothering them, they are easily woken. During this phase your baby is likely to wake if they went to sleep in your arms and you put them down. After active sleep they enter quiet sleep - this is when breathing is more rhythmic and it is like the deep sleep stage in adults. A baby's sleep cycle is around 45 minutes during the day (and shorten to be just 2 hours overnight) and if tired enough, if nothing is bothering them and have a full tummy, babies under 3 months will rouse between sleep cycles but then enter into another cycle of active through quiet sleep until they have had enough restorative sleep and wake up. \"},{\"p\":\"After 3 months babies go through a massive development in their sleep cycles and they don't drift from one to another so easily. \"},{\"p\":\"By four months they wake completely at the end of a sleep cycle, day and night, and need to consciously try to go back to sleep. This wakefulness is the part that is referred to as the "four- month regression". \"},{\"p\":\"Unfortunately, this sleep regression won't go away until your baby can totally self-settle, in other words, go to sleep on their own at the start of naps and bedtime and resettle themselves between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"Tips for approaching self settling:\"},{\"p\":\"Like learning to read, self-settling is a skill that doesn't simply develop overnight. It is something completely new for babies and they need a process of coaching, consistency and the chance to learn to do it themselves. Us giving in and continuing to settle them at the first grizzle means we're denying them the chance to work on this new skill; we're not doing them any favours in the long run.\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Encourage good sleep habits\"},{\"3\":\"A baby who is overtired or under tired will find it really hard to learn to self-settle \"},{\"4\":\"Consistency is absolutely key - don't give your baby mixed messages by allowing them to self-settle some of the time then settling them other times\"},{\"5\":\"A dark room, white noise, swaddle (for babies under 5 months) or baby sleeping bag are excellent positive sleep associations which greatly help your baby's chances of learning this new skill\"},{\"6\":\"A hungry baby won't settle no matter what you do\"},{\"7\":\"Have high expectations of your little one and work hard to achieve them\"}]}},{\"p\":\"We have various self-settling methods in our Program which can work with your babies existing association and parenting style to guide your LO toward this new skill. You can find these by using the filter 'Settling' \"},{\"h2\":\"The 8 Month Regression\"},{\"p\":\"There is another sleep regression around 8-10 months and it is all about the massive physiological and developmental changes your baby is experiencing at this time. At around this age, many babies are learning to crawl, might be pulling up to stand, they will have language explosions. This can mean your baby wants to wake in the night simply to practice their new skills! They might also start resisting some naps or waking earlier in the Lunch Nap. They are quite literally distracted by their own amazingness! This is completely normal, and unless they're really upset you are best to leave them to it. \"},{\"p\":\"It is during this time it can be easy to quickly establish some bad sleep habits as you might be inclined to go back to rocking or feeding your baby to get them back to sleep. This regression does go away and should only last a few weeks to a month on and off.\"},{\"p\":\"What happens during the 8-10 month sleep regression?\"},{\"p\":\"Separation anxiety\"},{\"p\":\"Babies become more aware of their surroundings at this age. You may have noticed that your little one has become clingier and they cry when they are left with someone other than you and that's because babies at this age start being able to tell one adult from another and they start to develop the concept of object permanence.\"},{\"p\":\"Object Permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be perceived (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way.) In the earlier months of your baby's life, you may have noticed that your wee one liked to play peek-a-boo, because in their minds once you had disappeared from their line of sight, you vanished and then you re-appeared again (best trick in the book), but for older babies this is no longer the case.\"},{\"p\":\"Nap Transitions\"},{\"p\":\"Somewhere between 6-8 months your baby will go from 3 naps to 2. This transition to 2 naps depends on your baby having consolidated their napping so that they are doing at least one good long nap (over 45 minutes) as well as one shorter nap during the day. \"},{\"p\":\"Signs of the 8-10 Month Regression:\"},{\"p\":\"The main sign that your little one is going through a regression is that their sleeping pattern takes a turn for the worse, but some other signs to look out for are:\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"The regression hits close to major milestones like crawling, pulling up, walking and talking\"},{\"3\":\"Waking more in the night and staying awake for ages\"},{\"4\":\"Fussiness\"},{\"5\":\"They can't resettle if they were previously able to\"},{\"6\":\"Refusing to nap\"},{\"7\":\"Crying when settling for a nap or at bedtime\"}]}},{\"p\":\"What causes the 8-10 Month Regression?\"},{\"p\":\"Nothing as such causes a regression as they are developmental phases that all babies go through. Unlike the pesky 4 month sleep regression, the 8-10 month regression is about physical and mental growth in your little one.\"},{\"p\":\"But there are certain things that happen alongside the regression that could affect their sleep like:\"},{\"p\":\"Physical Milestones\"},{\"p\":\"Your little one will be learning gross motor skills like walking, crawling, talking etc and this can be a lot to take in. Their brain may be too wired to sleep at night or they'll wake to practise their new set of skills.\"},{\"p\":\"Picture this - you've just came out of a long meeting and have had to take in a lot of new information and you try and sleep straight after, most likely it isn't going to happen because your brain is far too stimulated.\"},{\"p\":\"Mental Development\"},{\"p\":\"As we mentioned your little one is now more alert and aware of their surroundings and may start experiencing separation anxiety.\"},{\"p\":\"Nap Transition\"},{\"p\":\"Somewhere between 6-8 months your baby will go from 3 naps to 2.\"},{\"p\":\"Teething\"},{\"p\":\"Teething usually gets the blame for a lot of issues surrounding your wee one, but the truth is teething is actually a short lived nightmare and unless you can see the teeth breaking through the gums, this won't be the cause of any sleep disruption.\"},{\"p\":\"Ways through the regression:\"},{\"p\":\"We know it probably feels like it's one regression after another, but just remember they are natural developmental periods in your baby's life that are helping them to grow, mature and develop. And yes, it's tough, but you pulled through the 4 month regression (which is no easy feat) and remember there are plenty of things that you can do to help you and your little one along the way.\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Remember this is just a short phase and it will be over in a matter of weeks, so stick with it and stick to your routine and be careful not to start creating more dependent sleep habits/ associations that will be harder to shake off later.\"},{\"3\":\"Make sure your routine (naps and awake times) are age appropriate.  \"},{\"4\":\"Be sure to foster good sleep habits like:\"},{\"5\":\"Sleeping your little one in a totally dark room to allow the release of the sleep hormone melatonin\"},{\"6\":\"Have a good bedtime routine in place.\"},{\"7\":\"Use white noise to help get your baby to sleep. We have our Baby Sleep Shhh track available on Spotify, Google Music, Amazon Music or iTunes\"},{\"8\":\"Offer support to your baby if you need to in regard to settling, but remember to always give them the chance to self-settle.\"},{\"9\":\"Allow for lots of physical and mental stimulation during their awake time in the day.\"}]}},{\"h2\":\"6 & 12-15 Months\"},{\"p\":\"At these times there can be a hiccup in your baby's sleep as they go through nap transitions. It might seem like a sleep regression! At 6 months (or thereabouts) your baby drops their Afternoon Nap and then somewhere between 12-15 months your baby will drop the Morning Nap. While our Programs are carefully formulated to make these transitions as easy as possible for your baby (by gradually reducing the nap times until they're gone), there can still be a period of adjustment. This might mean your baby starts waking earlier in the morning or after one sleep cycle at bedtime for a few days. As with the 8-month regression, this will resolve itself and you need to be really careful not to interfere and create more sleep habits during this time!\"},{\"blockquote\":\"Even on this Program, your baby might experience disturbances to their sleep as they are adjusting to the changes in their neurology. However, you're lucky, because being on our Program means your baby has the best chance to minimise these disruptions and sail through the regressions a lot easier.\"}]}",

This is why the natural, biological bedtime for babies and children tends to be between 6:30 and 7:30 PM – just after dusk.\"},{\"p\":\"During summer months when the sun sets a lot later, many babies and young children struggle to settle and sleep if their room is still too sunny and bright. This is because the sleep hormones are not being produced to tell them it is time for night-time sleep; they can't switch into their night-time sleep cycles. We can get around this by creating a false night with blackout blinds or dark curtains. \"},{\"p\":\"Once asleep, the melatonin continues to rise in our bodies until midnight. This is why the period between bedtime and midnight is considered the most restorative sleep - we are being pumped full of those good sleep hormones. \"},{\"p\":\"After midnight the melatonin drops off, which can mean many babies sleep well up until midnight then wake every 2 hours beyond that (especially if they can't self-settle or if something is bothering them). \"},{\"p\":\"By around 5 AM the melatonin has gone out of our systems. This is the end of our night-time sleep cycles, and we enter a period of light sleep rather than the deep sleep we were in previously. \"},{\"p\":\"Here, if anything is bothering a baby such as hunger, getting a bit cold, hearing noises or they are unwell, they will really struggle to go back to sleep. \"},{\"h2\":\"Cortisol (the stress hormone)\"},{\"p\":\"Cortisol is a hormone that builds up during our waking hours and is a very natural part of our daytime cycle. Cortisol levels naturally increase in the day and are then reduced when we nap. In large doses, cortisol is similar to adrenaline or caffeine in the way it affects our bodies, so we don't want the levels to get too high in our babies because it will really affect their sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Napping during the day reduces the levels of cortisol, which is really important because high levels of this hormone will cause hyperactivity (common overtiredness behaviour) and will make it very hard for babies (and toddlers) to switch off and go to sleep. It would be like having a cup of coffee right before bedtime and then trying to sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"High levels of cortisol also inhibit the release of melatonin, meaning your baby won't be getting the good sleep hormones they need to go into a deep sleep overnight. \"},{\"p\":\"The long Lunch Nap in our Sleeping and Feeding Schedules is designed so your baby reduces their cortisol levels come bedtime in the evening. This is why we always aim to have the longest nap of the day at lunchtime, rather than in the morning. A baby who has been awake for too long for their age or hasn't had a nap of over 2 hours since midday will be very hard to settle at bedtime due to the high levels of cortisol that will have built up. This can cause a wake 45 minutes after bedtime in the evening because the cortisol is inhibiting your baby slipping into their night-time sleep cycles. It can contribute to early morning waking too. \"}]}",

This is the same for babies of all ages and is designed to coincide with the natural dip in energy levels we all (adults and babies alike) have between the hours of 12 and 2 PM. \"},{\"p\":\"Napping at this time means babies are more likely to fall asleep, stay asleep (all things going well) and it is when sleep will be the most restorative. \"},{\"p\":\"The other naps are then calculated around the Lunch Nap. \"},{\"p\":\"While it might be convenient or seem logical to let your baby have a longer nap in the morning followed by a shorter nap at lunch or in the afternoon, this can lead to problems closer to 6 months once the daytime sleep hours reduce naturally and your baby loses the late Afternoon Nap. This means their longest nap of the day would then be in the morning with only two short naps to get through the rest of the day, and by late afternoon they will be exhausted and need to go to bed by 6 PM (resulting in an unsettled night and potentially a 6 AM wake). Beyond 6 months, any sleep after 3 PM can mean your baby will not settle well at bedtime and correlates to a wakeful period at 3 AM. \"},{\"p\":\"Having a long Morning Nap also inhibits the consolidation of the early morning sleep phase (between 5 AM- 7 AM). This means an early wake is established and then reinforced by continuing to have a long Morning Nap.\"},{\"p\":\"During the transition to one nap, between 12-15 months old, your baby will have reduced and then dropped their Morning Nap altogether, leaving the Lunch Nap in place. This is a far easier transition than it would be for babies who are used to having a longer nap in the morning and a shorter one early afternoon because you'd be tweaking and readjusting two naps and converting them into one. \"},{\"p\":\"If you have a baby and a toddler, the Lunch Nap happens at the same time for both ages, so you will enjoy a couple of hours of bliss when both your kids are asleep! \"},{\"p\":\"Between 3-6 months the Lunch Nap can be difficult to achieve for a variety of reasons, these include hunger, settling issues (4-month sleep regression), sleep environment or the length of the Morning Nap. Your baby, despite being tired, might even refuse to go back to sleep. Use the troubleshooting notes to get through the rest of your day if the Lunch Nap doesn't go to plan. \"},{\"p\":\"It can take a few weeks for babies to get the hang of Lunch Nap but usually, by around 6 months, it will click into place. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"By establishing a good Lunch Nap early on, you will ensure your baby is not too overtired for the afternoon and bedtime is relaxed and happy.\"}]}",

They are a limit, not a goal. We can't tell you on a daily basis when your baby will definitely get tired because it will depend on what they have done during the day, how their night was, how their day naps have been so far. We can tell you the maximum time when all babies for that age group will get overtired. \"},{\"p\":\"Our Sleep Program differs from other programs because we offer this maximum awake time rather than an average awake time. Other programs might suggest 1 hour awake time for an 8-week-old, however, some 8-week-old babies might easily stay awake for 2 hours. In this example, 1 hour isn't going to work for them, and the mother will struggle to get her baby to go to sleep if their awake time is too short, or the baby will go to sleep with some active settling, but other problems will happen at different times of the day. \"},{\"p\":\"Babies vary in the scale of their sleep needs and some do need more sleep than others. This is why the awake times in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule are the maximum – your baby might need slightly less awake time than another baby of the same age. In this way, you're able to assess your own baby's individual sleep needs and tweak the times in the Schedule to suit your baby.\"},{\"p\":\"If your little one is doing slightly less awake time and still settling and napping until the normal wake-up time specified in the Schedule, that's great, and it's a sign your baby has slightly higher sleep needs. However, if your baby is doing less awake time than in the Schedule and waking regularly or hourly overnight; is difficult to settle to sleep; is waking early morning or only sleeping for 20-30 mins in a nap; the likely cause is they are undertired and their awake times need to be extended, so they consolidate their nights and naps to be longer. This can be done by stretching out their awake times by 5-10 minutes every 2 days. \"},{\"p\":\"We would not recommend doing more awake time than stated in the Schedule. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"The trap that a lot of parents will get into is thinking that their little one can only stay awake for a short time.\"},{\"p\":\"All babies have a natural dip in energy levels around the 1-1.5 hour mark of being awake. This is when many people assume their babies are tired and put them down for a sleep, only for their baby to have a tiny nap because they weren't quite tired enough to nap for longer. This energy dip is marked by your baby yawning or getting grizzly, but try and keep as close to the maximum awake time as you can. Usually changing your baby's activity will give them a second wind and get them through to their nap time - try changing their diaper, giving them some diaper-free time, taking them outside for some fresh air.\"},{\"p\":\"Some babies, when starting out on our Sleep Program, are genuinely unable to stay awake to the maximum awake time. This is common if a baby is recovering from a build-up of chronic overtiredness. If your baby goes to sleep before the scheduled nap time, let them sleep until the normal wake-up time as specified in the Schedule (i.e, their nap will be longer). You can aim to increase their awake time by 5-10 minutes every 2 days as their build-up of overtiredness decreases.\"},{\"p\":\"If however, your baby starts displaying any of the following behaviours, you'll need to scale back the nap lengths and/or increase the awake times: \"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"\\nBeing difficult to settle for naps and bedtime \\n\"},{\"3\":\"\\nNot sleeping until the nap wake time (i.e having shorter naps than the length recommended in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule) \\n\"},{\"4\":\"\\nNot sleeping for the full Lunch Nap \\n\"},{\"5\":\"\\nWaking more overnight, or more after midnight \\n\"},{\"6\":\"\\nStaying awake for periods in the night \\n\"},{\"7\":\"\\nWaking early in the morning \\n\"}]}},{\"p\":\"In regards to nap lengths, the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules can be flexible to accommodate your baby's different sleep needs. For example, you should only shorten your baby's Morning Nap length when it is beginning to impact on their Lunch Nap or night-time sleep - not just because they've reached a certain age. \"},{\"p\":\"It might take a few days of experimentation to get the right awake time vs sleep time for your baby's individual needs. \"},{\"p\":\"As your baby starts to sleep better for their naps and in the night, they will easily be able to stick to the awake times during the day.\"},{\"video\":\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312427226\"}]}",

If you're trying to put your baby to bed and they just seem like they want to party, they are not tired enough. This can easily get confused with overtiredness! Check the time your baby has been awake against the maximum awake time in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule for your baby's age – try and extend their awake time by 5 minutes each day. \"},{\"p\":\"If your baby seems tired and it is much earlier than the awake time, try changing their activity or taking them outside for some fresh air, to get them closer to the maximum awake time. \"},{\"p\":\"A baby who isn't awake for long enough between naps will generally have an unsettled period in the early evening or wakeful periods overnight as they just need some awake time! \"},{\"h3\":\"They're Too Tired \"},{\"p\":\"Babies who are overtired will find it really difficult to settle and go to sleep. Make sure you are using the correct awake time window for your baby's age to avoid overtiredness in the first place! Aim to put your baby to bed before the maximum awake time in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule, to allow time for them to settle to sleep. If the maximum awake time is approaching and they're not asleep yet, you can settle them totally to sleep so they don't get overtired.\"},{\"p\":\"If your baby has been awake longer than the maximum awake time, you will have to work hard to get them to go to sleep. Swaddle your baby, put them in a dark room and use loud white noise or our Baby Sleep Shhh track. Rock or bounce your baby to settle them to sleep or feed to sleep if you have to. Getting your baby to sleep to avoid overtiredness is more important at this age than the method you use to get them to sleep! \"},{\"h3\":\"They've Had Too Much Sleep \"},{\"p\":\"Babies need a very specific amount of daytime sleep in order for them to sleep well at night. If your baby has too much sleep in the day they won't settle easily or sleep for long enough overnight. If your baby is not settling easily or is very wakeful overnight, check their total nap hours against the nap totals in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule. If they've have more than the total daily nap hours in the Schedule, it's likely their wakefulness is caused by undertiredness. \"},{\"h3\":\"They Are Hungry \"},{\"p\":\"Hungry babies will not sleep! Even if you think they've had enough, if you've tried everything else and they still won't sleep, they might be hungry. If you think your baby seems constantly hungry, it might pay to have them checked by your doctor for a tongue or lip tie. Babies with a tie can appear to feed well and can even be gaining weight, but are often not able to have a big feed at each feeding session, meaning they're snack feeding all day. This can impact their sleep quite significantly and sometimes this can be the only indicating factor of a tie needing some medical attention.\"},{\"h3\":\"Temperature \"},{\"p\":\"Babies can easily become too hot or too cold because they're not able to regulate their own body temperature until they're a bit older. Being too hot or too cold will result in a baby who won't settle and sleep. Make sure you always dress your baby in appropriate clothing for the room temperature, use natural fibres such as cotton or merino and never sleep your baby in a hat. Check your baby's temperature by feeling their chest or back rather than their hands or face (which should feel cooler than their bodies, but not cold). \"},{\"p\":\"Overnight, temperatures can drop and so it is worthwhile having a thermostat on a heater to maintain a constant nursery temperature, or putting an extra blanket on your baby before you go to sleep. \"},{\"h3\":\"They Are Sick \"},{\"p\":\"If you notice a sudden change to your baby's sleep habits, such as sudden early waking, not settling well or suddenly waking between sleep cycles when they have previously been able to settle, they are likely unwell. Babies can have sore throats or ears and show no other symptoms, other than disrupted sleep. Take your baby to the doctor and get them checked out before you start looking at other reasons for their waking.\"}]}",

Here are our recommended items to achieve this (these things are not \\\"compulsory\\\" in order to successfully follow our Programs, however we have seen that they help the majority of babies!):\"},{\"h3\":\"A Dark Room\"},{\"p\":\"This can be done using blackout blinds or simply by putting a dark sheet or blanket under or over the existing curtains. You want to cover any light that might be sneaking in around the edges of the curtain. Babies do not fear the dark, in fact, like most mammals, they actually find the dark comforting, calming and safe. Do not use a nightlight either as the light can be very stimulating to babies, making it hard for them to settle or stay asleep for a long period.\"},{\"p\":\"Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary to sleep babies in daylight during the day to avoid any kind of day/night confusion. Having your baby in a good nap pattern for their day and ensuring their naps are at the right time and the right length will naturally help your baby understand the difference between night and day and consolidate their night-time sleep quicker. There are other cues to ensure no day/night confusion occurs, such as having plenty of communication during the day, making sure baby is getting the majority of their calorie intake during the day, and light exposure during their waking hours.\"},{\"p\":\"For babies older than 3 or 4 months, napping in a bright room can contribute to catnapping in the day, which can then lead to overtiredness at bedtime.\"},{\"h3\":\"White Noise\"},{\"p\":\"This is a great, easy settling and sleep tool for young babies. White noise not only replicates the loud whooshing sounds babies hear in the womb (sounds that are louder than a vacuum cleaner in utero), but hearing loud white noise also triggers the calming response in babies, especially if they are overtired, overstimulated or crying. What noise also disguises any noises from the household which might startle or wake a sleeping baby.\"},{\"p\":\"When babies reach around 4 months and start waking between sleep cycles, their senses fully switch on. Having white noise playing means they are hearing the same comforting sound they heard when they fell asleep and they'll find it easier to transition between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"We have a variety of white noise tracks available through iTunes, Spotify and Google Play, the best of which for babies under 6 months is our Baby Sleep Shhh. Experts recommend playing the white noise louder than your baby's cries (if they are crying) or as loud as a shower to encourage good sleep. Our advice is to play it at around 60dB. We recommend using white noise until at least 1 year of age for a baby's long nap and overnight.\"},{\"h3\":\"Swaddling\"},{\"p\":\"Using a swaddle for babies under 4 months is proven to help your baby settle and sleep well. Swaddling replicates the tight, confined feeling of being in the womb and ensures babies can't wake themselves up with their startle-reflex. Sometimes we hear that a baby doesn't like being swaddled but more often than not, this is simply because the swaddle isn't tight enough, the baby is already overtired or overstimulated, or they are too hot or cold. In general, babies do prefer to be swaddled.\"},{\"p\":\"By the time your baby reaches around 4 months old, they can start to be weaned off the swaddle for sleep.\"},{\"h3\":\"Cuddly/Comforter\"},{\"p\":\"Having a comforter or cuddly for sleep is a great tool to encourage self-settling in your baby. If they associate the comforter with bedtime and sleep, it will work as a strong signal to your baby when it is bedtime. Choose a comforter that is age appropriate, washable and preferably one that you can purchase two of (so you can interchange them when you need to wash one!). Keep the comforter close to you for a few days, in your bed or under your top or next to you and baby while feeding, so it absorbs your scent. Then give it to baby for every nap and at night-time. Make sure you never place objects close enough to your baby's face that they can become a suffocation hazard.\"},{\"p\":\"Remove everything from your baby's sleep environment that is not completely conducive to sleep - excessive toys and musical mobiles are often are hindrance to a baby's ability to self-settle. Why sleep when you have all these toys and stimulating things to look at?!\"},{\"p\":\" \"}]}",

In some cases, babies have to re-learn sleep skills due to the parts of their brain responsible for sleep changing and maturing. Other times the regressions are more to do with developments in their physical and/or social skills and around nap transitions. \"},{\"h2\":\"8 Week Sleep Regression\"},{\"p\":\"Many babies begin to catnap and start sleeping worse in the day from this age onward. Their newborn sleepiness has worn off and they are becoming a lot more alert. What also happens at this point is the maternal melatonin has finally come out of their system, so they need to produce their own melatonin to settle to sleep easily and sleep well. Melatonin is a sleep hormone that is only produced and released in the dark, so having a very dark room from this age onward really helps babies link sleep cycles and stay asleep during the Lunch Nap and overnight.If your baby is continuing to catnap past this point, even if you are using blackout blinds, it could be that their nap timings need a bit of tweaking to move them gently away from newborn sleeping patterns. \"},{\"h2\":\"The 4 Month Sleep Regression\"},{\"p\":\"A baby's sleep can dramatically change around the 4-month mark. You might have had an amazing sleeping newborn and suddenly they've started waking a lot more in the night and catnapping in the day. \"},{\"p\":\"This is commonly called the 4-month sleep regression; however, it is better not to think of it as a regression but more of a maturation of your baby's neurological development. Their brains are developing and their sleep is becoming more like ours as adults. \"},{\"p\":\"An adult sleep cycle goes through periods of deep sleep and periods of REM sleep. REM sleep is a lighter sleep where we dream and are more likely to be woken if something is different or bothering us in our environment. Our deep sleep is where we are unlikely to be woken. Adult sleep cycles are about 100 minutes long, then we rouse slightly and fall back asleep again, into the next sleep cycle without even realising it.\"},{\"p\":\"Young babies are a bit different. They have periods of active sleep and periods of quiet sleep. Active sleep is what the baby enters straight after falling asleep, this is like REM sleep in adults and they can be easily woken during this time. They breath shallower, can grunt, cry out and if anything is bothering them, they are easily woken. During this phase your baby is likely to wake if they went to sleep in your arms and you put them down. After active sleep they enter quiet sleep - this is when breathing is more rhythmic and it is like the deep sleep stage in adults. A baby's sleep cycle is around 45 minutes during the day (and shorten to be just 2 hours overnight) and if tired enough, if nothing is bothering them and have a full tummy, babies under 3 months will rouse between sleep cycles but then enter into another cycle of active through quiet sleep until they have had enough restorative sleep and wake up. \"},{\"p\":\"After 3 months babies go through a massive development in their sleep cycles and they don't drift from one to another so easily. \"},{\"p\":\"By four months they wake completely at the end of a sleep cycle, day and night, and need to consciously try to go back to sleep. This wakefulness is the part that is referred to as the "four- month regression". \"},{\"p\":\"Unfortunately, this sleep regression won't go away until your baby can totally self-settle, in other words, go to sleep on their own at the start of naps and bedtime and resettle themselves between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"Tips for approaching self settling:\"},{\"p\":\"Like learning to read, self-settling is a skill that doesn't simply develop overnight. It is something completely new for babies and they need a process of coaching, consistency and the chance to learn to do it themselves. Us giving in and continuing to settle them at the first grizzle means we're denying them the chance to work on this new skill; we're not doing them any favours in the long run.\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Encourage good sleep habits\"},{\"3\":\"A baby who is overtired or under tired will find it really hard to learn to self-settle \"},{\"4\":\"Consistency is absolutely key - don't give your baby mixed messages by allowing them to self-settle some of the time then settling them other times\"},{\"5\":\"A dark room, white noise, swaddle (for babies under 5 months) or baby sleeping bag are excellent positive sleep associations which greatly help your baby's chances of learning this new skill\"},{\"6\":\"A hungry baby won't settle no matter what you do\"},{\"7\":\"Have high expectations of your little one and work hard to achieve them\"}]}},{\"p\":\"We have various self-settling methods in our Baby Program which can work with your babies existing association and parenting style to guide your LO toward this new skill. If you find your LO hits this regression early - before 3 months (which does happen for some) we do have an age appropriate method to gradually and gently guide your LO toward this skill in this Program which you can find by filtering 'settling'.\"},{\"blockquote\":\"Even on this Program, your baby might experience disturbances to their sleep as they are adjusting to the changes in their neurology. However, you're lucky, because being on our Program means your baby has the best chance to minimise these disruptions and sail through the regressions a lot easier.\"}]}",

They are a limit, not a goal. We can't tell you on a daily basis when your baby will definitely get tired because it will depend on what they have done during the day, how their night was, how their day naps have been so far. We can tell you the maximum time when all babies for that age group will get overtired. \"},{\"p\":\"Our Sleep Program differs from other programs because we offer this maximum awake time rather than an average awake time. Other programs might suggest 2 hours awake time for a 6-month-old, however, some 6-month-old babies might easily stay awake for 2.5 hours. In this example, 2 hours isn't going to work for them, and the mother will struggle to get her baby to go to sleep if their awake time is too short, or the baby will go to sleep with some active settling, but other problems will happen at different times of the day. \"},{\"p\":\"Babies vary in the scale of their sleep needs and some do need more sleep than others. This is why the awake times in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule are the maximum – your baby might need slightly less awake time than another baby of the same age. In this way, you're able to assess your own baby's individual sleep needs and tweak the times in the Schedule to suit your baby. \"},{\"p\":\"If your little one is doing slightly less awake time and slightly more nap hours than in the Schedule and still settling and napping until the normal wake-up time, that's great, and it's a sign your baby has slightly higher sleep needs. However, if your baby is doing less awake time and more nap hours than in the Schedule and waking regularly or hourly overnight; is difficult to settle to sleep; is waking early morning or only sleeping for 20-30 mins in a nap; the likely cause is they are undertired and their awake times need to be extended/naps shortened, so they consolidate their nights and naps to be longer. This can be done by stretching out their awake times by 5-10 minutes every 2 days.\"},{\"p\":\"We would not recommend doing more awake time than stated in the Schedule. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"The trap that a lot of parents will get into is thinking that their little one can only stay awake for a short time.\"},{\"p\":\"All babies have a natural dip in energy levels around the 1-1.5 hour mark of being awake. This is when many people assume their babies are tired and put them down for a sleep, only for their baby to have a tiny nap because they weren't quite tired enough to nap for longer. This energy dip is marked by your baby yawning or getting grizzly, but try and keep as close to the maximum awake time as you can. Usually changing your baby's activity will give them a second wind and get them through to their nap time - try changing their diaper, giving them some diaper-free time, taking them outside for some fresh air.\"},{\"p\":\"Some babies, when starting out on our Sleep Program, are genuinely unable to stay awake to the maximum awake time. This is common if a baby is recovering from a build-up of chronic overtiredness. If your baby goes to sleep before the scheduled nap time, let them sleep until the normal wake-up time as specified in the Schedule (i.e, their nap will be longer). You can aim to increase their awake time by 5-10 minutes every 2 days as their build-up of overtiredness decreases.\"},{\"p\":\"If however, your baby starts displaying any of the following behaviours, you'll need to scale back the nap lengths and/or increase the awake times: \"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"\\nBeing difficult to settle for naps and bedtime \\n\"},{\"3\":\"\\nNot sleeping until the nap wake time (i.e having shorter naps than the length recommended in the Sleeping and Feeding Schedule) \\n\"},{\"4\":\"\\nNot sleeping for the full Lunch Nap \\n\"},{\"5\":\"\\nWaking more overnight, or more after midnight \\n\"},{\"6\":\"\\nStaying awake for periods in the night \\n\"},{\"7\":\"\\nWaking early in the morning \\n\"}]}},{\"p\":\"In regards to nap lengths, the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules can be flexible to accommodate your baby's different sleep needs.

If your baby is used to getting food or some form of communication in the night or early morning it stimulates a body clock trigger, like an alarm clock, which will continue to go off at the same time each night/morning.\"},{\"p\":\"For a habit wake before 6 AM, you need to teach them it's not morning. If your child is around 2 years you will be able to introduce a sleep training clock – see the section below about this.If your baby sees you between 5-6 AM that makes them think it's time to get up and they get into the habit of waking then. This means you can't go into the room during the process of breaking the habit wake.

There are many types available and they all do the same thing – you set the clock to the time you are happy to establish as "morning" and the clock will show a different colour or image when is it "morning".\"},{\"p\":\"You can do the same thing by using a timer device plugged into a radio or special light in your toddler's room. The radio/clock/light switching on will signal to your toddler that they are allowed to get out of bed.\"},{\"p\":\"This won't happen automatically. You have to re-train your toddler's body clock to establish the new time. If your toddler is waking at 5:30 AM and their new training clock isn't indicating morning until 7:00 AM they will not be able to achieve the goal of staying in their bed until morning. They are, essentially, being set up to fail.\"},{\"p\":\"Toddlers are very emotionally driven – they want to do the right thing and be praised for it. Setting small achievable goals is the best way to teach them.\"},{\"p\":\"To do this, after explaining the concept of the training clock to your toddler, you set the "morning" time on the clock to the time your toddler is already waking. On the first day,they will naturally wake and also see that it is morning on their clock. Goal achieved – they have stayed in their bed until "morning". Praise them!\"},{\"p\":\"Every 2 days you move the morning wake time on their clock back by 5 minutes. Each time, your toddler has to wait a little bit longer but they will know that they are able to achieve the goal. Always praise their efforts.

This nap stays the same approximate time and length from newborn right through to 2.5 years old. The other naps during the day are structured around the Lunch Nap, with the goal of achieving the 2 hours (or close to) for this nap. \"},{\"p\":\"As you move through the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules, the Morning Nap slowly decreases in length nearer to 12 months. This is to continue to promote a long Lunch Nap and also to allow for some more awake time in the morning, which your baby starts needing as they get older. \"},{\"p\":\"This means that you can adjust your baby's Morning Nap length as needed, to encourage a better/longer sleep at lunchtime. Gradually reducing the Morning Nap length also means that the transition to one nap, between 12-15 months, is a lot easier once the Morning Nap is simply a quick Power Nap. \"},{\"p\":\"Babies may differ slightly in the Morning Nap lengths that work best for them. One 8-month-old baby might be fine with a 30-minute Morning Nap and still do the full Lunch Nap, while another 8-month-old baby might need their Morning Nap trimmed to 20 minutes in order to do the full 2 hours at lunch.\"},{\"p\":\"You can play with the times of the Morning Nap as needed if your baby starts waking early from the Lunch Nap and you can rule out other factors such as settling issues, hunger, sleep environment. \"},{\"p\":\"By 12 months most babies will be doing no more than 15 minutes for their Morning Nap. \"},{\"p\":\"If your baby is going to sleep earlier than the times in the Guide and/or waking earlier than the wake-up times for their naps, you can use a Power Nap for babies under 8 months. This is a strict 10-minute nap that bridges the gap between their normal scheduled naps if it is greater thanthe maximum awake time. This means your baby can last until the next naptime, so you are back on track with your nap timings for the rest of the day. Babies over 8 months can be stretched out to the scheduled nap times (rather than working off their awake times like when they were younger) if they woke early from the morning or Lunch Naps or you will find you reach bedtime in the evening earlier than the scheduled time in the Guide. This can eventually create an early waking habit.\"},{\"blockquote\":\"If your baby is consistently waking earlier from their naps, you will need to look at the troubleshooting notes for each nap to\\ntry and figure out why.\"},{\"video\":\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/312420415\"}]}",

If you would like to get rid of the pacifier cold turkey, by using our Pacifier Fairy method, it is best to wait until your toddler has dropped their daytime nap altogether or you may really struggle to get a nap out of them without theirpacifier. Wait until there is nothing else major going on in your toddler's life, like a transition to a big bed, a new sibling or moving to a new house.\"},{\"h3\":\"Gradual Destruction \"},{\"p\":\"This method can work with a younger toddler. You gradually decimate their pacifier until it is no longer desirable for them to suck and it is their choice to discard it.\"},{\"p\":\"To start with, you'd pierce a hole in the end of the pacifier, then a few days later you'd cut the very top off, then cut down a bit more, then a bit more every few days. Eventually, if your toddler hasn't given up on it by now, you're left with a stub and your toddler won't want that!They will choose to get rid of it because the pacifier doesn't satisfy their sucking urge anymore.\"},{\"p\":\"Be careful about any loose pieces of rubber/latex as you cut the pacifier down – you don't want them to become a choking hazard for your toddler.\"},{\"h3\":\"The Pacifier Fairy \"},{\"p\":\"This mythical character is the cousin of the Tooth Fairy... and operates in a similar manner. She takes pacifiers in the night and leaves a present for the child. For this method to work your toddler needs to be old enough to understand this concept and have dropped their daytime nap – around 2 1⁄2 to 3years old is a good age.\"},{\"p\":\"In preparation for removing the pacifier, explain the Pacifier Fairy to your toddler a few days in advance. You could even google some fairy images and show your toddler what the Pacifier Fairy looks like. Ask your toddler what gift he/she would like from the Fairy. Tell them the Pacifier Fairy takes pacifiers off "big kids" and gives them to little babies who don't have any of their own.\"},{\"p\":\"Buy a gift.\"},{\"p\":\"On a designated night, your toddler will leave their pacifiers outside their room for the Fairy to collect in the night. It might be tricky for them to go to sleep at first and some cuddling, hand holding or lots and lots of stories might be in order. If your toddler also has other positive sleepassociations like a cuddly toy and a sleeping bag these will help make the process a lot easier – at least the pacifier is being replaced with something else comforting and not simply being removed.\"},{\"p\":\"Once asleep, take the pacifiers away and leave a gift in their place. A letter from the Pacifier Fairy always seals the deal and you could also include a photo of a baby who will be receiving the pacifiers.\"},{\"p\":\"If your toddler wakes overnight and seeks their pacifier, remind them that the Pacifier Fairy has taken them and some gentleness may be required around these night wakes while your toddler adjusts. Discussion about the present they'll likely receive should be enough to placate yourtoddler.\"},{\"p\":\"In the morning, they should be very excited to find the gift!\"},{\"p\":\"It can be a tricky few days or even weeks because your toddler needs to learn a whole new way of going to sleep. Give them respect, understanding and time to adapt.\"},{\"p\":\"If your toddler is really struggling you can sit in the room with them while they go to sleep but don't get into bed with them while they sleep as you will become the new sleep association. If you need to you can then follow the check method.\"},{\"blockquote\":\"It is a good idea to get rid of the pacifiers from the house altogether in case a) your toddler finds them hidden somewhere, or b) you have a moment of weakness and give them back to your toddler!\"}]}",

You will begin by settling your baby to sleep using your chosen method with the pacifier for 3 days. Then, you will put your baby down for their naps and at bedtime without the pacifier and you will settle them completely to sleep using your chosen settling method. Once they are used to going to sleep without the pacifier you will then work on removing the settling, by only settling to calm them rather than to put them to sleep.

The reason behind this, and the reason we're different to other sleep companies in this approach, is that if the night waking is caused by a self-settling issue, once your baby is self-settling before naps and at bedtime, their night wakes should naturally diminish or disappear on their own. It is also a lot easier to be consistent with a self-settling method during the day, when everything is less confronting, than at night when you're tired and your baby is tired and it is more tempting to \\\"give up\\\". We generally see that by improving your baby's settling when they fall asleep for naps and at bedtime, their all-round settling improves as a result.\"},{\"p\":\"We know there is no "one-size-fits-all" for families and a method that works for one family might not be effective for another. This is why we offer many options, so you can choose what works best for you.\"},{\"p\":\"While guiding your child to independent sleep, sometimes older babies and toddlers can get frustrated by settling attempts and a continued parental presence – they get confused as to why the parent is soothing them but not giving them the specific sleep association they are used toor want. For these children, often just giving them some space to work it out on their own is more beneficial to them than constantly trying to settle or soothe them.\"},{\"p\":\"While we at no point advocate leaving your baby to cry if they're distressed or you are uncomfortable, it is important to understand your baby's cries:\"},{\"p\":\"1. Protest crying: this is a loud insistent cry, which almost sounds like shouting. This cry is the equivalent of your baby yelling at you and is a direct response to something happening that they don't necessarily like or didn't expect.\"},{\"p\":\"2. Crying up or "winding up": this is distressed crying and it escalates in volume and intensity.\"},{\"p\":\"3. Crying down or "winding down": this is a cry or grizzle that gets more spaced out, quieter or weaker and is a baby's way of winding down, especially if they are overstimulated or overtired.\"},{\"p\":\"Please refer the Glossary below if needed, to better understand the terms and methods. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"Choose which method to follow depending on your baby's temperament, what their current sleep association is and your parenting style.\"},{\"p\":\"*Your baby must also be following the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules while using these Settling & Self-Settling Methods. \"},{\"h2\":\"Glossary\"}]}",

Just like how you go to sleep at night. This means if your baby is relying on you to do something for them in order for them to fall asleep, it's not self-settling. If you have to put a pacifier in their mouth, this is technically not self-settling unless the baby can do it themselves. \"},{\"p\":\"Sleep habits are very easily formed in babies older than 3 months. The way we put our babies down to sleep, as well as the way we resettle them during naps or in the night, will dictate how they learn to go to sleep. We call these things "sleep associations"; cues or behaviours your baby associates so strongly with going to sleep that they can't sleep without them. The most common sleep associations for babies are feeding, rocking or patting to sleep or the use of a pacifier. The way babies are put to sleep at the start of a nap or at bedtime is the only way they know how to go to sleep. If they then wake at the end of a sleep cycle and that same sleep association isn't there, they will not be able to go back to sleep without it. This is why your baby may start waking every 45 minutes during the day and every 2 hours in the night and needing your help to go back to sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Sleep associations are a normal part of falling asleep. Even as adults we need something to help us fall asleep (such as a pillow and blankets). It's when these associations disrupt your baby's sleep, because they require your assistance, that it becomes a problem. If a baby relies on a parent-controlled sleep association to fall asleep at the start of a nap or at bedtime, they will then need the same conditions replicated when they surface from their sleep cycles during the day and in the night.\"},{\"p\":\"We can categorise the tools babies use/require to get to sleep in two categories - baby controlled and parent controlled.\"},{\"p\":\" \"},{\"h3\":\"Baby Controlled Sleep Associations\"},{\"p\":\"These are things that a baby can easily access or use or do themselves to assist them to fall asleep, or things in a baby's sleep environment that signal it is time for sleep.

Here are our recommended items to achieve this (these things are not "compulsory" in order to successfully follow our Programs, however we have seen that they help the majority of babies!).\"},{\"h2\":\"A Dark Room\"},{\"p\":\"This can be done using blackout blinds or simply by putting a dark sheet or blanket under or over the existing curtains. You want to cover any light that might be sneaking in around the edges of the curtain. Babies do not fear the dark, in fact, like most mammals, they actually find the dark comforting, calming and safe. Do not use a nightlight either as the light can be very stimulating to babies, making it hard for them to settle or stay asleep for a long period. \"},{\"p\":\"Contrary to popular belief, it is not necessary to sleep babies in daylight during the day to avoid any kind of day/night confusion. Having your baby in a good nap pattern for their day and ensuring their naps are at the right time and the right length will naturally help your baby understand the difference between day and night and consolidate their night-time sleep quicker. There are other cues to ensure no day/night confusion occurs, such as having plenty of communication during the day, making sure your baby is getting the majority of their calorie intake during the day, and light exposure during their waking hours.\"},{\"p\":\"Napping in a bright room can contribute to catnapping in the day, which can then lead to overtiredness at bedtime. \"},{\"h2\":\"White Noise\"},{\"p\":\"This is a great, easy settling and sleep tool for young babies but it definitely also helps older babies settle and sleep for longer too. White noise not only replicates the loud whooshing sounds babies hear in the womb (sounds that are louder than a vacuum cleaner in utero), but hearing loud white noise also triggers the calming response in babies, especially if they are overtired, overstimulated or crying. White noise also disguises any noises from the household which might startle or wake a sleeping baby.\"},{\"p\":\"For babies over 4 months who start waking between sleep cycles, their senses fully switch on. Having white noise playing means they are hearing the same comforting sound they heard when they fell asleep and they'll find it easier to transition between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"We have a variety of white noise tracks available through iTunes, Spotify and GooglePlay, the best of which for babies under 6 months is our Baby Sleep Shhh. Experts recommend playing the white noise louder than your baby's cries (if they are crying) or as loud as a shower to encouragegood sleep. Our advice is to play it at around 60dB. We recommend using white noise until at least 1 year of age for a baby's long nap and overnight.\"},{\"h2\":\"Baby Sleeping Bag/Sleep Sack \"},{\"p\":\"Many people chose to put their older baby or toddler in blankets rather than use a baby or toddler sleeping bag. This is fine if your toddler is over 3 years old. A toddler younger than this will not have the ability to pull their blankets up in the night or the notion to do so if they get cold. Toddlers can become tangled and frustrated by blankets and this is a common cause of night waking in a toddler who was previously sleeping well! Our advice is to keep your toddler in a sleeping bag as long as possible – this will also prevent them from getting too cold in the early morning and it can also mean they're less likely to get out of bed once you transition them into a big bed. If you would like to make the change to blankets for your older toddler, the best time todo it is in summer when there is less chance of them getting cold overnight.\"},{\"p\":\"Often babies and toddlers wake in the night or early morning due to being too cold. We can misinterpret their waking for hunger or a settling issue and end up feeding or rocking or resettling our babies, which can create a waking habit. Using a baby sleeping bag can help make sure your baby stays nice and warm all night long. We recommend sleeping bags that are made of natural fibres - cotton, wool, bamboo, merino - as these are much safer for your baby and will mean they won't overheat (a risk factor for SIDS).\"},{\"p\":\"Avoid using polar fleece or polyester sleeping bags as these are quite dangerous. Having a room thermometer is good too, so you can make sure you are dressing baby in the right clothing for their room temperature as some babies are very sensitive to even the slightest temperature change.\"},{\"p\":\"Here is a useful clothing and temperature guide for sleeping bags: \"},{\"table\":[[\"Room Temp\",\"Winter Weight \\nMerino Bag\",\"Mid Weight \\nMerino Bag\",\"Summer Weight\\nMerino Bag\",\"Tog Rated\\nBag\"],[\"26 C/78 F\",\"\",\"\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit\",\"0.5 tog & short sleeved bodysuit\"],[\"24 C/75 F\",\"\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit\",\"1.0 tog & short sleeved bodysuit\"],[\"22 C/71 F\",\"\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit & pyjama pants\",\"\",\"1.0 tog & long sleeved bodysuit + pyjama pants\"],[\"20 C/68 F\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit & pyjamas\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit & pyjamas\",\"\",\"2.5 tog & short sleeved bodysuit + pyjamas\"],[\"18 C/64 F\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit, pyjamas and socks\",\"\",\"\",\"2.5 togLong sleeved bodysuit + pyjamas and socks\"]]},{\"h2\":\"Cuddly/Comforter\"},{\"p\":\"Having a comforter or cuddly for sleep is a great tool to encourage self-settling in your baby. If they associate the comforter with bedtime and sleep, it will work as a strong signal to your baby when it is bedtime. Choose a comforter that is age-appropriate, washable and preferably one that you can purchase two of (so you can interchange them when you need to wash one!). Keep the comforter close to you for a few days, in your bed or under your top or next to you and baby while feeding, so it absorbs your scent. Then give it to baby for every nap and at night-time. Make sure you never place objects close enough to your baby's face that they can become a suffocation hazard. \"},{\"p\":\"Remove anything from your baby's sleep environment that is not completely conducive to sleep - excessive toys and musical mobiles are often a hindrance to a baby's ability to settle. Why sleep when you have all these toys and stimulating things to look at?! \"}]}",

    "content": "{\"contents\":[{\"p\":\"Babies go through several periods in the first year where they experience \\\"sleep regressions\\\". In some cases, babies have to re-learn sleep skills due to the parts of their brain responsible for sleep changing and maturing. Other times the regressions are more to do with developments in their physical and/or social skills and around nap transitions. \"},{\"h2\":\"The 4 Month Sleep Regression\"},{\"p\":\"A baby's sleep can dramatically change around the 4-month mark. You might have had an amazing sleeping newborn and suddenly they've started waking a lot more in the night and catnapping in the day. \"},{\"p\":\"This is commonly called the 4-month sleep regression; however, it is better not to think of it as a regression but more of a maturation of your baby's neurological development. Their brains are developing and their sleep is becoming more like ours as adults. \"},{\"p\":\"An adult sleep cycle goes through periods of deep sleep and periods of REM sleep. REM sleep is a lighter sleep where we dream and are more likely to be woken if something is different or bothering us in our environment. Our deep sleep is where we are unlikely to be woken. Adult sleep cycles are about 100 minutes long, then we rouse slightly and fall back asleep again, into the next sleep cycle without even realising it.\"},{\"p\":\"Young babies are a bit different. They have periods of active sleep and periods of quiet sleep. Active sleep is what the baby enters straight after falling asleep, this is like REM sleep in adults and they can be easily woken during this time. They breath shallower, can grunt, cry out and if anything is bothering them, they are easily woken. During this phase your baby is likely to wake if they went to sleep in your arms and you put them down. After active sleep they enter quiet sleep - this is when breathing is more rhythmic and it is like the deep sleep stage in adults. A baby's sleep cycle is around 45 minutes during the day (and shorten to be just 2 hours overnight) and if tired enough, if nothing is bothering them and have a full tummy, babies under 3 months will rouse between sleep cycles but then enter into another cycle of active through quiet sleep until they have had enough restorative sleep and wake up. \"},{\"p\":\"After 3 months babies go through a massive development in their sleep cycles and they don't drift from one to another so easily. \"},{\"p\":\"By four months they wake completely at the end of a sleep cycle, day and night, and need to consciously try to go back to sleep. This wakefulness is the part that is referred to as the "four- month regression". \"},{\"p\":\"Unfortunately, this sleep regression won't go away until your baby can totally self-settle, in other words, go to sleep on their own at the start of naps and bedtime and resettle themselves between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"Tips for approaching self settling:\"},{\"p\":\"Like learning to read, self-settling is a skill that doesn't simply develop overnight. It is something completely new for babies and they need a process of coaching, consistency and the chance to learn to do it themselves. Us giving in and continuing to settle them at the first grizzle means we're denying them the chance to work on this new skill; we're not doing them any favours in the long run.\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Encourage good sleep habits\"},{\"3\":\"A baby who is overtired or under tired will find it really hard to learn to self-settle \"},{\"4\":\"Consistency is absolutely key - don't give your baby mixed messages by allowing them to self-settle some of the time then settling them other times\"},{\"5\":\"A dark room, white noise, swaddle (for babies under 5 months) or baby sleeping bag are excellent positive sleep associations which greatly help your baby's chances of learning this new skill\"},{\"6\":\"A hungry baby won't settle no matter what you do\"},{\"7\":\"Have high expectations of your little one and work hard to achieve them\"}]}},{\"p\":\"We have various self-settling methods in our Program which can work with your babies existing association and parenting style to guide your LO toward this new skill. You can find these by using the filter 'Settling' \"},{\"h2\":\"The 8 Month Regression\"},{\"p\":\"There is another sleep regression around 8-10 months and it is all about the massive physiological and developmental changes your baby is experiencing at this time. At around this age, many babies are learning to crawl, might be pulling up to stand, they will have language explosions. This can mean your baby wants to wake in the night simply to practice their new skills! They might also start resisting some naps or waking earlier in the Lunch Nap. They are quite literally distracted by their own amazingness! This is completely normal, and unless they're really upset you are best to leave them to it. \"},{\"p\":\"It is during this time it can be easy to quickly establish some bad sleep habits as you might be inclined to go back to rocking or feeding your baby to get them back to sleep. This regression does go away and should only last a few weeks to a month on and off.\"},{\"p\":\"What happens during the 8-10 month sleep regression?\"},{\"p\":\"Separation anxiety\"},{\"p\":\"Babies become more aware of their surroundings at this age. You may have noticed that your little one has become clingier and they cry when they are left with someone other than you and that's because babies at this age start being able to tell one adult from another and they start to develop the concept of object permanence.\"},{\"p\":\"Object Permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be perceived (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way.) In the earlier months of your baby's life, you may have noticed that your wee one liked to play peek-a-boo, because in their minds once you had disappeared from their line of sight, you vanished and then you re-appeared again (best trick in the book), but for older babies this is no longer the case.\"},{\"p\":\"Nap Transitions\"},{\"p\":\"Somewhere between 6-8 months your baby will go from 3 naps to 2. This transition to 2 naps depends on your baby having consolidated their napping so that they are doing at least one good long nap (over 45 minutes) as well as one shorter nap during the day. \"},{\"p\":\"Signs of the 8-10 Month Regression:\"},{\"p\":\"The main sign that your little one is going through a regression is that their sleeping pattern takes a turn for the worse, but some other signs to look out for are:\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"The regression hits close to major milestones like crawling, pulling up, walking and talking\"},{\"3\":\"Waking more in the night and staying awake for ages\"},{\"4\":\"Fussiness\"},{\"5\":\"They can't resettle if they were previously able to\"},{\"6\":\"Refusing to nap\"},{\"7\":\"Crying when settling for a nap or at bedtime\"}]}},{\"p\":\"What causes the 8-10 Month Regression?\"},{\"p\":\"Nothing as such causes a regression as they are developmental phases that all babies go through. Unlike the pesky 4 month sleep regression, the 8-10 month regression is about physical and mental growth in your little one.\"},{\"p\":\"But there are certain things that happen alongside the regression that could affect their sleep like:\"},{\"p\":\"Physical Milestones\"},{\"p\":\"Your little one will be learning gross motor skills like walking, crawling, talking etc and this can be a lot to take in. Their brain may be too wired to sleep at night or they'll wake to practise their new set of skills.\"},{\"p\":\"Picture this - you've just came out of a long meeting and have had to take in a lot of new information and you try and sleep straight after, most likely it isn't going to happen because your brain is far too stimulated.\"},{\"p\":\"Mental Development\"},{\"p\":\"As we mentioned your little one is now more alert and aware of their surroundings and may start experiencing separation anxiety.\"},{\"p\":\"Nap Transition\"},{\"p\":\"Somewhere between 6-8 months your baby will go from 3 naps to 2.\"},{\"p\":\"Teething\"},{\"p\":\"Teething usually gets the blame for a lot of issues surrounding your wee one, but the truth is teething is actually a short lived nightmare and unless you can see the teeth breaking through the gums, this won't be the cause of any sleep disruption.\"},{\"p\":\"Ways through the regression:\"},{\"p\":\"We know it probably feels like it's one regression after another, but just remember they are natural developmental periods in your baby's life that are helping them to grow, mature and develop. And yes, it's tough, but you pulled through the 4 month regression (which is no easy feat) and remember there are plenty of things that you can do to help you and your little one along the way.\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Remember this is just a short phase and it will be over in a matter of weeks, so stick with it and stick to your routine and be careful not to start creating more dependent sleep habits/ associations that will be harder to shake off later.\"},{\"3\":\"Make sure your routine (naps and awake times) are age appropriate.  \"},{\"4\":\"Be sure to foster good sleep habits like:\"},{\"5\":\"Sleeping your little one in a totally dark room to allow the release of the sleep hormone melatonin\"},{\"6\":\"Have a good bedtime routine in place.\"},{\"7\":\"Use white noise to help get your baby to sleep. We have our Baby Sleep Shhh track available on Spotify, Google Music, Amazon Music or iTunes\"},{\"8\":\"Offer support to your baby if you need to in regard to settling, but remember to always give them the chance to self-settle.\"},{\"9\":\"Allow for lots of physical and mental stimulation during their awake time in the day.\"}]}},{\"h2\":\"6 & 12-15 Months\"},{\"p\":\"At these times there can be a hiccup in your baby's sleep as they go through nap transitions. It might seem like a sleep regression! At 6 months (or thereabouts) your baby drops their Afternoon Nap and then somewhere between 12-15 months your baby will drop the Morning Nap. While our Programs are carefully formulated to make these transitions as easy as possible for your baby (by gradually reducing the nap times until they're gone), there can still be a period of adjustment. This might mean your baby starts waking earlier in the morning or after one sleep cycle at bedtime for a few days. As with the 8-month regression, this will resolve itself and you need to be really careful not to interfere and create more sleep habits during this time!\"},{\"h2\":\"15-18 Months\"},{\"p\":\"This regression can be quite a frustrating one. It's often down to a big milestone they are hitting - they are figuring out where they fit in the world and finding their sense of self:They want to do everything themselves, they're testing boundaries and figuring out their limits as well as ours. They know exactly what they want and how to get it but often can't communicate it well enough for us to understand straight away which often leads to tantrums.There is a huge bout of separation anxiety that strikes at this age and your toddler can become clingy and upset when going down for a nap and at bedtime - this is where those sleep habits like patting them to sleep, lying down with them or staying in their room while they fall asleep can be really quickly established. Toddlers are smart and even just a day or 2 of a new habit will stick like glue, then can be very hard to break.They may also still be feeling the effects of the transition down to one nap. This can be a very long drawn out process until they sort themselves out and consolidate their sleep again. It can be tricky as they can get stuck in a bit of a cycle where they wake early in the morning so need a morning nap and it makes it very hard to drop to 1 nap. Sometimes if this is happening you may need to take drastic action and push through from the early start to a slightly earlier lunch nap, say 11:45am, for a few days to break the cycle. If your toddler hasn't already transitioned to 1 nap and you are starting to have some issues like difficulty settling for bed or early waking then it may be time to drop the morning nap.\"},{\"p\":\"One of the main issues that crops up around this age is taking an age to settle to sleep at bedtime. It's quite important to keep to nap timings as they'll not be ready to cut their lunch nap back from 2 hours just yet. This 'fluffing' at bedtime is usually related to the developmental changes and the re-consolidation of their sleep and will pass given time. It's important that if your LO has been self settling well to try not to intervene too much in this 'fluffing' as it can inadvertently bring in those tricky new habits.If your toddler does develop some new associations during this stage you will need to use one of the self settling methods outlined in this Program to guide them back toward more independent settling again. Since they already 'know how' to do it it shouldn't take too long with patience and consistency.\"},{\"h2\":\"2 Years\"},{\"p\":\"At this age, your toddler can start resisting bedtime at night. They might do this by happily playing or chatting in their bed, standing up and moving around, or they might be upset. This is a time when your toddler is very aware of their environment and will realise that the life of the family is going on after they are put to bed. They don't want to miss out! Because your toddler is still having a day nap, their staying power is very strong; they can resist going to sleep for a long time. Their behaviour, however, is not a sign of needing to drop the nap, as many people can assume, but sometimes reducing the nap length can be worthwhile, to see if that helps your child settle. \"},{\"p\":\"It can be easy to get into the habit of assisting your toddler to sleep during this time. Bear in mind that toddlers will  quickly develop a new sleep association – you – and they will then forcefully resist changing this habit. You could try playing a lullaby for a few minutes to help settle them without you needing to be in the room. If your toddler does develop an association during this time you can use the settling methods outlined in the Program to help guide them back to more independent settling.How Naps Affect things:What can start to affect sleep at around two years old is your toddler's daytime nap and how that is impacting their bedtime settling and their night sleep. If their bedtime is already a battle, you want to make sure that it's not being made worse by the timing and the length of their daytime sleep. Toddlers at this age definitely still need a daytime nap; it is too young for your toddler to have dropped their nap altogether, and yes, there will be days during this regression (and it can go on for a couple of months) where your toddler might refuse to nap full-stop for a day, but those days are going to be relatively few and far between. On those days, it's going to feel like hell in the late afternoon and your toddler is more likely to nap the next day because they'll be so tired.For their daytime nap at this age you'd be aiming have that nap happening across the middle of the day and for no more than around an hour and a half to two hours. Two hours would be the absolute maximum your toddler should be napping at this age, and for some toddlers who have lower sleep needs than others, two hours might even be a little bit too long to expect them to then go to sleep at 7 PM that night. If your toddler is napping for longer than two hours, that is definitely going to be affecting their bedtime settling in the evening because they're just not tired enough to settle easily to sleep and all of their FOMO, all of their toddler tricks are coming out and they're going to fight you and resist bedtime. The biggest culprit of that is simply that they're not tired enough to settle easily to sleep. They can't give into sleep yet. Their will to be awake is too strong. So what you'd want to do in that case is move your toddler's nap a bit earlier in the day and trim it in length so there's a decent chunk of at least four and a half to five hours of them being awake from the end of their nap until bedtime. What can also happen is if your toddler is napping too early in the day or for too short a period, they're actually going to be reaching bedtime very overtired and this is going to be problematic with the two year regression as well. When we're overtired, we have a build-up of stress hormones in our body like adrenaline and this makes us go into fight or flight mode. You can guarantee your toddler is going to be in full swing fight mode! An overtired toddler will actually look like a toddler who's quite hyperactive, who seems to have a second wind, and is very loud and excitable and energetic, but that's actually as a result of those hormones coursing through their body, which are making them wild. We all know that these toddlers are never easily going to submit to sleep. And so you combine that with their FOMO, with what we know about how your toddler now views the world and it's a recipe for disaster at bedtime.So if your toddler is napping before midday, their nap is too early and their awake window after their nap is going to be far too long before bedtime, meaning they are going to reach bedtime very, very overtired. If your toddler is napping around the middle of the day but not for very long, perhaps half an hour or 45 minutes, at two years old, that's probably a bit too short. And if you're then trying to put your toddler down at, say, 7 PM for bedtime, they're going to bed overtired. If your toddler's nap just needs to be pushed out or moved a little bit, that's not a very difficult fix. However, if your toddler is in the habit of sleeping for just one sleep cycle of 45 minutes for their nap, as a result of the inability to self-settle, ie if they need you to actively put them to sleep at the start of that nap (and you're probably doing that at bedtime and also overnight as well), then that's going to contribute to them only sleeping for that one sleep cycle. You'd want to look at some strategies of how to help your toddler learn to fall asleep independently and we've got a lot of strategies and methods in the settling section of this Program.Ways through the Regression:\"},{\"p\":\"So once you've got their nap happening at the right time and for the right lengths, then you can start to look at your toddler's settling to sleep for that nap and at bedtime, and look at whether it is a giant case of FOMO or whether there's something else going on that's inhibiting their ability to settle easily to sleep. Some easy strategies that you can implement to assist your toddler go to sleep are:\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Having a really nice, calming, quiet wind-down routine. You'd have a shorter one before their nap and a slightly longer one, including a bath, at bedtime, where perhaps you'd take your toddler to their room, make it dark, turn on some white noise, read them some books, just to give them a chance to get their head around the fact that they're expected to sleep, that this is the expectation that they're not just being whisked right out the middle of an exciting activity and chucked in their bedroom.\"},{\"3\":\"Even at this age, and you can certainly reintroduce it during this regression, using white noise is a really good way to help your toddler switch off because they focus on the sound of the white noise and helps their brain switch off from anything else that they might be thinking about.\"},{\"4\":\"I would also avoid having too many stimulating things in your toddler's bedroom like toys or activities because your toddler is immediately going to prefer to do those things rather than go to sleep.\"},{\"5\":\"And if at all possible, avoid moving your toddler into a bed and keep them in a cot as long as you can because as soon as they have the ability to get up and come out of their room, they're going to do that and you're going to be putting them back to bed a hundred times every evening. \"}]}},{\"p\":\"Good Nutrition will help:Some other areas to look at to help your toddler when they're difficult to settle are their diet and their nutrition. We know nutrition plays a really big role in the ability for all us to sleep well, and toddlers are certainly no exception and arguably they are more susceptible to stimulants like sugar and caffeine. So you need to make sure your toddler is eating the right kind of food to assist in sleep because any sweets, or candy, or food with sugar, or any drinks that contain caffeine like cola, are NOT going to help your child settle and sleep.There are actually quite a few foods that do assist with sleep and these foods are high in tryptophan, which is found in foods like bananas, turkey, chicken, dairy products. This enzyme actually helps the release of melatonin in our bodies. There are other foods where melatonin is found and these are mainly kiwi fruit and tart cherry or sour cherry. It's a good idea to look at giving your toddler foods rich in melatonin or tryptophan around lunch time or earlier in the day because it will help the serotonin levels build up in their body throughout the afternoon and these then convert to melatonin. If they've got high serotonin levels, they're going to have a lot of melatonin coursing through their body in the evening and this is going to help them settle and sleep. We would also be making sure your toddler is getting enough protein and that can be protein at their lunchtime meal and also protein at dinnertime, because protein is really going to fill them up. Make sure they're also having lots of nice starchy carbs in the evening for the same reason. Your toddler does not need dessert! They don't need ice cream, they don't need chocolate pudding or candy after dinner because this is really, really going to impact their night-time settling. A great dessert (if you have to have dessert) is fruit, particularly bananas. A bit of a treat is a banana sliced length-ways, smeared with peanut butter, sandwiched back together and chopped into little sections. It's healthy, it contains the right kind of fats that your child needs for their developing brain and also contains key sleep enzymes that are going to help your toddler settle easier at bedtime.\"},{\"p\":\" \"},{\"blockquote\":\"Even on this Program, your baby might experience disturbances to their sleep as they are adjusting to the changes in their neurology. However, you're lucky, because being on our Program means your baby has the best chance to minimise these disruptions and sail through the regressions a lot easier.\"}]}",

Melatonin is a sleep hormone that is released in the dark and is responsible for us falling asleep and staying asleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Melatonin governs our night-time sleep cycles (which are longer than daytime sleep cycles) and differentiates night sleep from day sleep in our brains. \"},{\"p\":\"Traditionally speaking (before we were able to prolong daylight via electric lights) as dusk approached our bodies would have started to release this hormone, making us sleepy leading up to bedtime. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"Melatonin is only produced in the dark. This is why the natural, biological bedtime for babies and children tends to be between 6:30 and 7:30 PM – just after dusk.\"},{\"p\":\"During summer months when the sun sets a lot later, many babies and young children struggle to settle and sleep if their room is still too sunny and bright. This is because the sleep hormones are not being produced to tell them it is time for night-time sleep; they can't switch into their night-time sleep cycles. We can get around this by creating a false night with blackout blinds or dark curtains. \"},{\"p\":\"Once asleep, the melatonin continues to rise in our bodies until midnight. This is why the period between bedtime and midnight is considered the most restorative sleep - we are being pumped full of those good sleep hormones. \"},{\"p\":\"After midnight the melatonin drops off, which can mean many babies sleep well up until midnight then wake every 2 hours beyond that (especially if they can't self-settle or if something is bothering them). \"},{\"p\":\"By around 5 AM the melatonin has gone out of our systems. This is the end of our night-time sleep cycles, and we enter a period of light sleep rather than the deep sleep we were in previously. \"},{\"p\":\"Here, if anything is bothering a baby such as hunger, getting a bit cold, hearing noises or they are unwell, they will really struggle to go back to sleep. \"},{\"h2\":\"Cortisol (the stress hormone)\"},{\"p\":\"Cortisol is a hormone that builds up during our waking hours and is a very natural part of our daytime cycle. Cortisol levels naturally increase in the day and are then reduced when we nap. In large doses, cortisol is similar to adrenaline or caffeine in the way it affects our bodies, so we don't want the levels to get too high in our babies because it will really affect their sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Napping during the day reduces the levels of cortisol, which is really important because high levels of this hormone will cause hyperactivity (common overtiredness behaviour) and will make it very hard for babies (and toddlers) to switch off and go to sleep. It would be like having a cup of coffee right before bedtime and then trying to sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"High levels of cortisol also inhibit the release of melatonin, meaning your baby won't be getting the good sleep hormones they need to go into a deep sleep overnight. \"},{\"p\":\"The long Lunch Nap in our Sleeping and Feeding Schedules is designed so your baby reduces their cortisol levels come bedtime in the evening. This is why we always aim to have the longest nap of the day at lunchtime, rather than in the morning. A baby who has been awake for too long for their age or hasn't had a nap of over 2 hours since midday will be very hard to settle at bedtime due to the high levels of cortisol that will have built up. This can cause a wake 45 minutes after bedtime in the evening because the cortisol is inhibiting your baby slipping into their night-time sleep cycles. It can contribute to early morning waking too. \"}]}",

So, by focusing on getting good naps happening, we can see big improvements with a baby's night sleep without having to do any sort of \\\"sleep training\\\". Good predictable naps also mean a baby's mother or caregiver can have some down-time during the day, which is very important to her mental and emotional wellbeing.\"},{\"p\":\"But good napping isn't always easy.\"},{\"p\":\"From 4 months, a baby's daytime sleep cycles will develop fully and be organised in noticeable 45 minutes chunks. This is developmentally normal and it happens to all babies, usually around 16 weeks old. This is called the "4 month sleep regression."\"},{\"p\":\"At this time, catnapping can become really common and babies can start napping for just one sleep cycle for each nap, of 45 minutes.\"},{\"p\":\"This is fine if it's working for you and your baby and their night sleep isn't being affected!\"},{\"p\":\"However, for some babies, continued catnapping can mean they become overtired, cranky and irritable and it can start to impact on their nights.\"},{\"p\":\"This is why, while we encourage shorter Morning and Afternoon Naps, we always aim for one long restorative Lunch Nap. When a baby naps for longer than one sleep cycle, they receive a multitude of physiological benefits, including the restoration of immune function and energy levels, appetite regulation, cortisol lowering and new skill processing.\"},{\"p\":\"For these reasons, our Programs are built on the framework of the 2-hour Lunch Nap, ensuring your baby has that big chunk of restorative sleep.\"},{\"p\":\"If your baby is/was catnapping all day but still sleeping well at night, what can happen is that somewhere between 4-6 months their night time sleep cycles will also shorten to be just 2 hours long. This can mean they are now catnapping in the day and also having a broken night sleep.\"},{\"p\":\"At this point, we'd want to look at tackling those catnaps to help improve night sleep and that night mean adjusting your baby's awake windows or working on self-settling to help them link sleep cycles.\"},{\"blockquote\":\"By focusing on naps and working towards a self-settling baby who is achieving a long lunchtime sleep, we are giving babies the best chance of good sleep overnight, sometimes without having to change anything in their night-time sleep!\"}]}",

The most common contributing factors are decreased physical activity, increased screen time and unhealthy food choices. Childhood obesity can have a huge impact on children in the short and long term both physiologically and psychologically. Excess weight in children must be handled very carefully by everyone in the family, and sensitivity with this topic is very important. First and foremost it is important not to mention your little one's weight, but instead focus on creating an environment that allows them to learn to listen to their body's hunger and fullness cues and to encourage healthy eating and exercise for growth and development not for weight loss. Let reaching a healthy weight be a happy side effect of healthy eating for growth and development, not the other way around. \"},{\"p\":\"A very important part of creating this positive eating environment is to encourage healthy eating for the whole family. Try not to have nutrient-poor, energy-dense foods in the home and don't allow treats for children who are a healthy weight and deny them for children who have excess weight. Do not give preferred foods as rewards for eating non-preferred foods; these practices could have the opposite effect and lead to a focus on unhealthy foods, creating the \\\"I'm not allowed them so I want them more\\\" or \\\"this food is a reward so I will use it to make me feel good\\\" phenomenons. \"},{\"p\":\" \"},{\"p\":\"The following are some helpful tips for helping to create a positive eating environment for little ones with excess weight: \"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Eat breakfast every day\"},{\"3\":\"Drink water instead of soft drinks, juice or cordial\"},{\"4\":\"Snacks should not be high in sugar or saturated fat: stick to the rule of 1 complex carbohydrate and 1 protein food\"},{\"5\":\"Limit fast food and take away\"},{\"6\":\"Stick to the 5 food groups and stick to recommended serving sizes\"},{\"7\":\"Encourage mindful eating and eating when you're full.

It can be really confusing to keep up with their nutrition requirements at each stage and it can sometimes feel like a minefield with under-eating leading to deficiencies and poor growth, and overeating leading to an increased risk of disease in later life (1)(2). Confusing questions like "how do I encourage more variety in my little ones diet" and "how much should my little one be eating each day" or "how much calcium does my little one need?" will constantly come up and with so much conflicting information available on the internet as well as differing advice from family and friends, it is hard to decipher what is scientifically correct or 'evidence based' so that you can make the right decisions for your child. And why does this matter? Because we are the generation that cares about the why. \"},{\"p\":\"We want to know that there is a scientific reason for why we are doing something. We won't accept kids menus that only offer chicken nuggets and chips anymore; we know how important nutrition is and we want to give our kids the best start in life that we possibly can. \"},{\"p\":\"Before writing this Program we had so many parents asking for a simple but scientific guide that explains the what, when, where, why and how of children's nutrition. \"},{\"p\":\"So we have created just that! This Program has been developed by an accredited practising Dietitian (and mother) with a background in biochemistry, human biology and medical nutrition therapy and all recommendations are made using the latest scientific evidence (3).\"},{\"blockquote\":\"Most importantly, we have created this program with the goal of providing comprehensive, clear information so that you can be confident in making choices around your child's nutrition yourself.\"},{\"p\":\"This Program not only includes age specific guides with sample menus, recipes, meal and snack ideas, but also an exciting section about nutrition for sleep and the role nutrition plays in helping both children and parents to get a better night's sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"This Program is designed to complement our Sleep Programs and the feeding times in our Sleeping and Feeding Schedules. It is also a complete stand-alone Program in its own right, for those of you who are not also following our toddler sleep recommendations. \"},{\"p\":\"If at any time on your child's feeding journey you have questions or would like more guidance, you are welcome to ask for help in the Little Ones Village, found in our custom-built app. The Nutrition Village is facilitated by accredited practising Dietitians, who are available to give further advice, as are the other families using this Program, as needed.  \"}]}",

Always check foods per 100g, not per serve (as this is an arbitrary amount created by the manufacturer) and allows a standard amount to compare similar foods.\"],[\"Saturated fat\",\"Try to choose foods with the least amount of saturated fat possible. Products with less than 3g per 100g are the best options.\"],[\"Sugars\",\"Avoiding all sugar is not necessary but avoiding added sugar where possible is best. Sometimes sugar content will be high because the foods (such as fruit) naturally contain sugar, however if a food product contains more than 15g per 100g check that the ingredients list does not contain added sugar.\"],[\"Fibre\",\"Foods that contain 6g of fibre per 100g are considered high fibre foods. Try to select high fibre options when choosing breads and cereals (whole grains).\"],[\"Sodium\",\"When comparing similar foods (e.g. different types of cheese) try to choose the option with the lowest sodium per 100g. Foods that have 400mg of sodium per 100g are good options, however foods that have less than 120mg of sodium per 100g are the best options.\"]]}]}",

It is important to make note of the Nutrient Reference Values (NRV section) in this program to check that your little one is meeting this nutrient needs, particularly for iron, B12, zinc, iodine and calcium. Please note that the author of this guide acknowledges that vegetarian diets have been strongly associated with positive health outcomes such as a decreased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adults and the reasons for vegetarianism are multifactorial. These recommendations are based on what can provide the most adequate nutrition for infants at this particular age to ensure their best growth outcomes.\"},{\"h2\":\"Vegan Diets\"},{\"p\":\"Vegan diets are not usually recommended for children due to the lower bioavailability of plant sources of iron, lower protein content and lack of Vitamin B12 among other nutrients.\"},{\"p\":\"If you plan on feeding your child a vegan diet please speak to your G.P. or Dietitian for one to one care.\"}]}",

If your baby is used to getting food or some form of communication in the night or early morning it stimulates a body clock trigger, like an alarm clock, which will continue to go off at the same time each night/morning.\"},{\"p\":\"For a habit wake before 6 AM, you need to teach them it's not morning. If your child is around 2 years you will be able to introduce a sleep training clock – see the section below about this.If your baby sees you between 5-6 AM that makes them think it's time to get up and they get into the habit of waking then. This means you can't go into the room during the process of breaking the habit wake. It will take at least three days to break the habit.\"},{\"p\":\" \"},{\"h2\":\"Sleep Training Clock Method (for 2yrs +)\"},{\"p\":\"If your toddler is in an early waking habit, you will first need to check their naps and night-time sleep against the relevant Sleeping and Feeding Guide for their age.

The radio/clock/light switching on will signal to your toddler that they are allowed to get out of bed.\"},{\"p\":\"This won't happen automatically. You have to re-train your toddler's body clock to establish the new time. If your toddler is waking at 5:30 AM and their new training clock isn't indicating morning until 7:00 AM they will not be able to achieve the goal of staying in their bed until morning. They are, essentially, being set up to fail.\"},{\"p\":\"Toddlers are very emotionally driven – they want to do the right thing and be praised for it. Setting small achievable goals is the best way to teach them.\"},{\"p\":\"To do this, after explaining the concept of the training clock to your toddler, you set the "morning" time on the clock to the time your toddler is already waking. On the first day,they will naturally wake and also see that it is morning on their clock. Goal achieved – they have stayed in their bed until "morning". Praise them!\"},{\"p\":\"Every 2 days you move the morning wake time on their clock back by 5 minutes. Each time, your toddler has to wait a little bit longer but they will know that they are able to achieve the goal. Always praise their efforts.

The reason behind this, and the reason we're different to other sleep companies in this approach, is that if the night waking is caused by a self-settling issue, once your toddler is self-settling before naps and at bedtime, their night wakes should naturally diminish or disappear on their own. It is also a lot easier to be consistent with a self-settling method during the day, when everything is less confronting, than at night when you're tired and your child is tired and it is more tempting to \\\"give up\\\". We generally see that by improving your toddler's settling when they fall asleep for naps and at bedtime, their all-round settling improves as a result.\"},{\"p\":\"We know there is no "one-size-fits-all" for families and a method that works for one family might not be effective for another. This is why we offer many options, so you can choose what works best for you.\"},{\"p\":\"While guiding your child to independent sleep, sometimes older babies and toddlers can get frustrated by settling attempts and a continued parental presence – they get confused as to why the parent is soothing them but not giving them the specific sleep association they are used toor want. For these children, often just giving them some space to work it out on their own is more beneficial to them than constantly trying to settle or soothe them.\"},{\"p\":\"While we at no point advocate leaving your baby to cry if they're distressed or you are uncomfortable, it is important to understand your baby's cries:\"},{\"p\":\"1. Protest crying: this is a loud insistent cry, which almost sounds like shouting. This cry is the equivalent of your toddler yelling at you and is a direct response to something happening that they don't necessarily like or didn't expect.\"},{\"p\":\"2. Crying up or "winding up": this is distressed crying and it escalates in volume and intensity.\"},{\"p\":\"3. Crying down or "winding down": this is a cry or grizzle that gets more spaced out, quieter or weaker and is a toddler's way of winding down, especially if they are overstimulated or overtired.\"},{\"p\":\"Please refer the Glossary below if needed, to better understand the terms and methods. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"Choose which method to follow depending on your child's temperament, what their current sleep association is and your parenting style.\"},{\"p\":\"*Your toddler must also be following the Sleeping and Feeding Schedules while using these Settling & Self-Settling Methods. \"},{\"h2\":\"Glossary\"}]}",

Just like how you go to sleep at night. This means if your toddler is relying on you to do something for them in order for them to fall asleep, it's not self-settling. If you have to put a pacifier in their mouth, this is technically not self-settling unless the toddler can do it themselves. \"},{\"p\":\"Sleep habits are very easily formed in babies older than 3 months. The way we put our babies down to sleep, as well as the way we resettle them during naps or in the night, will dictate how they learn to go to sleep. We call these things "sleep associations"; cues or behaviours your child associates so strongly with going to sleep that they can't sleep without them. The most common sleep associations for babies and toddlers are feeding, rocking or patting to sleep or the use of a pacifier. The way children are put to sleep at the start of a nap or at bedtime is the only way they know how to go to sleep. If they then wake at the end of a sleep cycle and that same sleep association isn't there, they will not be able to go back to sleep without it. \"},{\"p\":\"Sleep associations are a normal part of falling asleep. Even as adults we need something to help us fall asleep (such as a pillow and blankets). It's when these associations disrupt your child's sleep, because they require your assistance, that it becomes a problem.

White noise not only replicates the loud whooshing sounds babies hear in the womb (sounds that are louder than a vacuum cleaner in utero), but hearing loud white noise also triggers the calming response in babies, especially if they are overtired, overstimulated or crying. White noise also disguises any noises from the household which might startle or wake a sleeping baby.\"},{\"p\":\"We have a variety of white noise tracks available through iTunes, Spotify and GooglePlay,  We recommend using white noise until at least 1 year of age for a toddler's long nap and overnight, however many people still choose to use it for older toddlers too.\"},{\"h2\":\"Sleeping Bag/Sleep Sack \"},{\"p\":\"Many people chose to put their older baby or toddler in blankets rather than use a baby or toddler sleeping bag. This is fine if your toddler is over 3 years old. A toddler younger than this will not have the ability to pull their blankets up in the night or the notion to do so if they get cold. Toddlers can become tangled and frustrated by blankets and this is a common cause of night waking in a toddler who was previously sleeping well! Our advice is to keep your toddler in a sleeping bag as long as possible – this will also prevent them from getting too cold in the early morning and it can also mean they're less likely to get out of bed once you transition them into a big bed. If you would like to make the change to blankets for your older toddler, the best time todo it is in summer when there is less chance of them getting cold overnight.\"},{\"p\":\"Often babies and toddlers wake in the night or early morning due to being too cold. We can misinterpret their waking for hunger or a settling issue and end up feeding or rocking or resettling our babies, which can create a waking habit. Using a baby sleeping bag can help make sure your baby stays nice and warm all night long. We recommend sleeping bags that are made of natural fibres - cotton, wool, bamboo, merino - as these are much safer for your baby and will mean they won't overheat (a risk factor for SIDS).\"},{\"p\":\"Avoid using polar fleece or polyester sleeping bags as these are quite dangerous. Having a room thermometer is good too, so you can make sure you are dressing baby in the right clothing for their room temperature as some babies are very sensitive to even the slightest temperature change.\"},{\"p\":\"Here is a useful clothing and temperature guide for sleeping bags: \"},{\"table\":[[\"Room Temp\",\"Winter Weight \\nMerino Bag\",\"Mid Weight \\nMerino Bag\",\"Summer Weight\\nMerino Bag\",\"Tog Rated\\nBag\"],[\"26 C/78 F\",\"\",\"\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit\",\"0.5 tog & short sleeved bodysuit\"],[\"24 C/75 F\",\"\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit\",\"1.0 tog & short sleeved bodysuit\"],[\"22 C/71 F\",\"\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit & pyjama pants\",\"\",\"1.0 tog & long sleeved bodysuit + pyjama pants\"],[\"20 C/68 F\",\"Short sleeved bodysuit & pyjamas\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit & pyjamas\",\"\",\"2.5 tog & short sleeved bodysuit + pyjamas\"],[\"18 C/64 F\",\"Long sleeved bodysuit, pyjamas and socks\",\"\",\"\",\"2.5 togLong sleeved bodysuit + pyjamas and socks\"]]},{\"h2\":\"Cuddly/Comforter\"},{\"p\":\"Cuddly/Comforter Having a comforter or cuddly for sleep is a great tool to encourage self-settling in your baby. If they associate the comforter with bedtime and sleep, it will work as a strong signal to your baby when it is bedtime. Choose a comforter that is age-appropriate, washable and preferably one that you can purchase two of (so you can interchange them when you need to wash one!). Keep the comforter close to you for a few days, in your bed or under your top or next to you and baby while feeding, so it absorbs your scent. Then give it to baby for every nap and at night-time. Make sure you never place objects close enough to your baby's facethat they can become a suffocation hazard.\"},{\"p\":\"Remove anything from your baby's sleep environment that is not completely conducive to sleep - excessive toys and musical mobiles are often a hindrance to a baby's ability to self-settle.

In some cases, babies have to re-learn sleep skills due to the parts of their brain responsible for sleep changing and maturing. Other times the regressions are more to do with developments in their physical and/or social skills and around nap transitions. \"},{\"h2\":\"The 4 Month Sleep Regression\"},{\"p\":\"A baby's sleep can dramatically change around the 4-month mark. You might have had an amazing sleeping newborn and suddenly they've started waking a lot more in the night and catnapping in the day. \"},{\"p\":\"This is commonly called the 4-month sleep regression; however, it is better not to think of it as a regression but more of a maturation of your baby's neurological development. Their brains are developing and their sleep is becoming more like ours as adults. \"},{\"p\":\"An adult sleep cycle goes through periods of deep sleep and periods of REM sleep. REM sleep is a lighter sleep where we dream and are more likely to be woken if something is different or bothering us in our environment. Our deep sleep is where we are unlikely to be woken. Adult sleep cycles are about 100 minutes long, then we rouse slightly and fall back asleep again, into the next sleep cycle without even realising it.\"},{\"p\":\"Young babies are a bit different. They have periods of active sleep and periods of quiet sleep. Active sleep is what the baby enters straight after falling asleep, this is like REM sleep in adults and they can be easily woken during this time. They breath shallower, can grunt, cry out and if anything is bothering them, they are easily woken. During this phase your baby is likely to wake if they went to sleep in your arms and you put them down. After active sleep they enter quiet sleep - this is when breathing is more rhythmic and it is like the deep sleep stage in adults. A baby's sleep cycle is around 45 minutes during the day (and shorten to be just 2 hours overnight) and if tired enough, if nothing is bothering them and have a full tummy, babies under 3 months will rouse between sleep cycles but then enter into another cycle of active through quiet sleep until they have had enough restorative sleep and wake up. \"},{\"p\":\"After 3 months babies go through a massive development in their sleep cycles and they don't drift from one to another so easily. \"},{\"p\":\"By four months they wake completely at the end of a sleep cycle, day and night, and need to consciously try to go back to sleep. This wakefulness is the part that is referred to as the "four- month regression". \"},{\"p\":\"Unfortunately, this sleep regression won't go away until your baby can totally self-settle, in other words, go to sleep on their own at the start of naps and bedtime and resettle themselves between sleep cycles.\"},{\"p\":\"Tips for approaching self settling:\"},{\"p\":\"Like learning to read, self-settling is a skill that doesn't simply develop overnight. It is something completely new for babies and they need a process of coaching, consistency and the chance to learn to do it themselves.

You can find these by using the filter 'Settling' \"},{\"h2\":\"12 to 15 Months\"},{\"p\":\"In this period there can be a hiccup in your child's sleep as they go through a big nap transition from 2 naps to 1. It might seem like a sleep regression! Somewhere between 12-15 months your toddler will drop the Morning Nap. While our Programs are carefully formulated to make this transition as easy as possible for your child (by gradually reducing the morning nap time until it's gone), there can still be a period of adjustment. This might mean your toddler starts waking earlier in the morning or after one sleep cycle at bedtime for a few days. This will resolve itself once through the transition and you need to be really careful not to interfere and create more sleep habits during this time! \"},{\"h2\":\"15-18 Months\"},{\"p\":\"This regression can be quite a frustrating one. It's often down to a big milestone they are hitting - they are figuring out where they fit in the world and finding their sense of self:They want to do everything themselves, they're testing boundaries and figuring out their limits as well as ours. They know exactly what they want and how to get it but often can't communicate it well enough for us to understand straight away which often leads to tantrums.There is a huge bout of separation anxiety that strikes at this age and your toddler can become clingy and upset when going down for a nap and at bedtime - this is where those sleep habits like patting them to sleep, lying down with them or staying in their room while they fall asleep can be really quickly established. Toddlers are smart and even just a day or 2 of a new habit will stick like glue, then can be very hard to break.They may also still be feeling the effects of the transition down to one nap. This can be a very long drawn out process until they sort themselves out and consolidate their sleep again. It can be tricky as they can get stuck in a bit of a cycle where they wake early in the morning so need a morning nap and it makes it very hard to drop to 1 nap. Sometimes if this is happening you may need to take drastic action and push through from the early start to a slightly earlier lunch nap, say 11:45am, for a few days to break the cycle. If your toddler hasn't already transitioned to 1 nap and you are starting to have some issues like difficulty settling for bed or early waking then it may be time to drop the morning nap.\"},{\"p\":\"One of the main issues that crops up around this age is taking an age to settle to sleep at bedtime. It's quite important to keep to nap timings as they'll not be ready to cut their lunch nap back from 2 hours just yet. This 'fluffing' at bedtime is usually related to the developmental changes and the re-consolidation of their sleep and will pass given time. It's important that if your LO has been self settling well to try not to intervene too much in this 'fluffing' as it can inadvertently bring in those tricky new habits.If your toddler does develop some new associations during this stage you will need to use one of the self settling methods outlined in this Program to guide them back toward more independent settling again. Since they already 'know how' to do it it shouldn't take too long with patience and consistency.\"},{\"h2\":\"2 Years\"},{\"p\":\"At this age, your toddler can start resisting bedtime at night. They might do this by happily playing or chatting in their bed, standing up and moving around, or they might be upset. This is a time when your toddler is very aware of their environment and will realise that the life of the family is going on after they are put to bed. They don't want to miss out! Because your toddler is still having a day nap, their staying power is very strong; they can resist going to sleep for a long time. Their behaviour, however, is not a sign of needing to drop the nap, as many people can assume, but sometimes reducing the nap length can be worthwhile, to see if that helps your child settle. \"},{\"p\":\"It can be easy to get into the habit of assisting your toddler to sleep during this time. Bear in mind that toddlers will  quickly develop a new sleep association – you – and they will then forcefully resist changing this habit. You could try playing a lullaby for a few minutes to help settle them without you needing to be in the room. If your toddler does develop an association during this time you can use the settling methods outlined in the Program to help guide them back to more independent settling.How Naps Affect things:What can start to affect sleep at around two years old is your toddler's daytime nap and how that is impacting their bedtime settling and their night sleep. If their bedtime is already a battle, you want to make sure that it's not being made worse by the timing and the length of their daytime sleep. Toddlers at this age definitely still need a daytime nap; it is too young for your toddler to have dropped their nap altogether, and yes, there will be days during this regression (and it can go on for a couple of months) where your toddler might refuse to nap full-stop for a day, but those days are going to be relatively few and far between. On those days, it's going to feel like hell in the late afternoon and your toddler is more likely to nap the next day because they'll be so tired.For their daytime nap at this age you'd be aiming have that nap happening across the middle of the day and for no more than around an hour and a half to two hours. Two hours would be the absolute maximum your toddler should be napping at this age, and for some toddlers who have lower sleep needs than others, two hours might even be a little bit too long to expect them to then go to sleep at 7 PM that night. If your toddler is napping for longer than two hours, that is definitely going to be affecting their bedtime settling in the evening because they're just not tired enough to settle easily to sleep and all of their FOMO, all of their toddler tricks are coming out and they're going to fight you and resist bedtime. The biggest culprit of that is simply that they're not tired enough to settle easily to sleep. They can't give into sleep yet. Their will to be awake is too strong. So what you'd want to do in that case is move your toddler's nap a bit earlier in the day and trim it in length so there's a decent chunk of at least four and a half to five hours of them being awake from the end of their nap until bedtime. What can also happen is if your toddler is napping too early in the day or for too short a period, they're actually going to be reaching bedtime very overtired and this is going to be problematic with the two year regression as well. When we're overtired, we have a build-up of stress hormones in our body like adrenaline and this makes us go into fight or flight mode. You can guarantee your toddler is going to be in full swing fight mode! An overtired toddler will actually look like a toddler who's quite hyperactive, who seems to have a second wind, and is very loud and excitable and energetic, but that's actually as a result of those hormones coursing through their body, which are making them wild. We all know that these toddlers are never easily going to submit to sleep. And so you combine that with their FOMO, with what we know about how your toddler now views the world and it's a recipe for disaster at bedtime.So if your toddler is napping before midday, their nap is too early and their awake window after their nap is going to be far too long before bedtime, meaning they are going to reach bedtime very, very overtired. If your toddler is napping around the middle of the day but not for very long, perhaps half an hour or 45 minutes, at two years old, that's probably a bit too short. And if you're then trying to put your toddler down at, say, 7 PM for bedtime, they're going to bed overtired. If your toddler's nap just needs to be pushed out or moved a little bit, that's not a very difficult fix. However, if your toddler is in the habit of sleeping for just one sleep cycle of 45 minutes for their nap, as a result of the inability to self-settle, ie if they need you to actively put them to sleep at the start of that nap (and you're probably doing that at bedtime and also overnight as well), then that's going to contribute to them only sleeping for that one sleep cycle. You'd want to look at some strategies of how to help your toddler learn to fall asleep independently and we've got a lot of strategies and methods in the settling section of this Program.Ways through the Regression:\"},{\"p\":\"So once you've got their nap happening at the right time and for the right lengths, then you can start to look at your toddler's settling to sleep for that nap and at bedtime, and look at whether it is a giant case of FOMO or whether there's something else going on that's inhibiting their ability to settle easily to sleep. Some easy strategies that you can implement to assist your toddler go to sleep are:\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Having a really nice, calming, quiet wind-down routine. You'd have a shorter one before their nap and a slightly longer one, including a bath, at bedtime, where perhaps you'd take your toddler to their room, make it dark, turn on some white noise, read them some books, just to give them a chance to get their head around the fact that they're expected to sleep, that this is the expectation that they're not just being whisked right out the middle of an exciting activity and chucked in their bedroom.\"},{\"3\":\"Even at this age, and you can certainly reintroduce it during this regression, using white noise is a really good way to help your toddler switch off because they focus on the sound of the white noise and helps their brain switch off from anything else that they might be thinking about.\"},{\"4\":\"I would also avoid having too many stimulating things in your toddler's bedroom like toys or activities because your toddler is immediately going to prefer to do those things rather than go to sleep.\"},{\"5\":\"And if at all possible, avoid moving your toddler into a bed and keep them in a cot as long as you can because as soon as they have the ability to get up and come out of their room, they're going to do that and you're going to be putting them back to bed a hundred times every evening. \"}]}},{\"p\":\"Good Nutrition will help:Some other areas to look at to help your toddler when they're difficult to settle are their diet and their nutrition. We know nutrition plays a really big role in the ability for all us to sleep well, and toddlers are certainly no exception and arguably they are more susceptible to stimulants like sugar and caffeine. So you need to make sure your toddler is eating the right kind of food to assist in sleep because any sweets, or candy, or food with sugar, or any drinks that contain caffeine like cola, are NOT going to help your child settle and sleep.There are actually quite a few foods that do assist with sleep and these foods are high in tryptophan, which is found in foods like bananas, turkey, chicken, dairy products. This enzyme actually helps the release of melatonin in our bodies. There are other foods where melatonin is found and these are mainly kiwi fruit and tart cherry or sour cherry. It's a good idea to look at giving your toddler foods rich in melatonin or tryptophan around lunch time or earlier in the day because it will help the serotonin levels build up in their body throughout the afternoon and these then convert to melatonin. If they've got high serotonin levels, they're going to have a lot of melatonin coursing through their body in the evening and this is going to help them settle and sleep. We would also be making sure your toddler is getting enough protein and that can be protein at their lunchtime meal and also protein at dinnertime, because protein is really going to fill them up. Make sure they're also having lots of nice starchy carbs in the evening for the same reason. Your toddler does not need dessert! They don't need ice cream, they don't need chocolate pudding or candy after dinner because this is really, really going to impact their night-time settling.

A bit of a treat is a banana sliced length-ways, smeared with peanut butter, sandwiched back together and chopped into little sections.

Melatonin is a sleep hormone that is released in the dark and is responsible for us falling asleep and staying asleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Melatonin governs our night-time sleep cycles (which are longer than daytime sleep cycles) and differentiates night sleep from day sleep in our brains. \"},{\"p\":\"Traditionally speaking (before we were able to prolong daylight via electric lights) as dusk approached our bodies would have started to release this hormone, making us sleepy leading up to bedtime. \"},{\"blockquote\":\"Melatonin is only produced in the dark. This is why the natural, biological bedtime for babies and children tends to be between 6:30 and 7:30 PM – just after dusk.\"},{\"p\":\"During summer months when the sun sets a lot later, many babies and young children struggle to settle and sleep if their room is still too sunny and bright. This is because the sleep hormones are not being produced to tell them it is time for night-time sleep; they can't switch into their night-time sleep cycles. We can get around this by creating a false night with blackout blinds or dark curtains. \"},{\"p\":\"Once asleep, the melatonin continues to rise in our bodies until midnight. This is why the period between bedtime and midnight is considered the most restorative sleep - we are being pumped full of those good sleep hormones. \"},{\"p\":\"After midnight the melatonin drops off, which can mean many children sleep well up until midnight then wake every 2 hours beyond that (especially if they can't self-settle or if something is bothering them). \"},{\"p\":\"By around 5 AM the melatonin has gone out of our systems. This is the end of our night-time sleep cycles, and we enter a period of light sleep rather than the deep sleep we were in previously. \"},{\"p\":\"Here, if anything is bothering a baby such as hunger, getting a bit cold, hearing noises or they are unwell, they will really struggle to go back to sleep. \"},{\"h2\":\"Cortisol (the stress hormone)\"},{\"p\":\"Cortisol is a hormone that builds up during our waking hours and is a very natural part of our daytime cycle. Cortisol levels naturally increase in the day and are then reduced when we nap. In large doses, cortisol is similar to adrenaline or caffeine in the way it affects our bodies, so we don't want the levels to get too high in our toddlers because it will really affect their sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"Napping during the day reduces the levels of cortisol, which is really important because high levels of this hormone will cause hyperactivity (common overtiredness behaviour) and will make it very hard for toddlers to switch off and go to sleep. It would be like having a cup of coffee right before bedtime and then trying to sleep. \"},{\"p\":\"High levels of cortisol also inhibit the release of melatonin, meaning your child won't be getting the good sleep hormones they need to go into a deep sleep overnight. \"},{\"p\":\"The long Lunch Nap in our Sleeping and Feeding Schedules is designed so your toddler reduces their cortisol levels come bedtime in the evening. This is why we always aim to have the longest nap of the day at lunchtime, rather than in the morning. A toddler who has been awake for too long for their age or hasn't had a nap of around 2 hours since midday will be very hard to settle at bedtime due to the high levels of cortisol that will have built up. This can cause a wake 45 minutes after bedtime in the evening because the cortisol is inhibiting your toddler slipping into their night-time sleep cycles. It can contribute to early morning waking too. \"}]}",

    "content": "{\"contents\":[{\"p\":\"Night training your child can come any time from 2 weeks to a year after they are day trained. Your child absolutely has to take the lead on this one. Your indicators are very simple and will be:\"},{\"ul\":{\"li\":[{\"2\":\"Your child wakes with a dry night nappy/diaper every morning for 2 weeks\"},{\"3\":\"Your child suddenly starts sleeping worse in the night; waking for no apparent reason (they may or may not have a dry nappy/diaper in the morning).\"}]}},{\"p\":\"This second indicator can be a tricky one to pinpoint as night waking can also be due to many other factors. Usually if your child has been day trained for quite a while and you can rule out sickness or any other factor, they are probably waking because their body is telling them they need to wee but they haven't yet learnt how to deal with going wees in the night. They will then not be able to easily go back to sleep because they have a full bladder and don't want to consciously go wees in their nappy.\"},{\"p\":\"For day naps, if your child consistently wakes with a dry nappy/diaper for 2 weeks, you can discard the nappy/diaper at naptime.Night training is extremely simple. If your child has been waking in the morning for 2 weeks with a consistently dry nappy/diaper, your work is done! Make sure your child always goes wees before bed and has no liquids to drink in the hour leading up to bedtime. Discuss with them that they don't need their night "sleep underwear" anymore, but don't use underwear on them at night for the first few weeks – just loose pyjama pants. (Having tight clothes around theirbottom might make the child feel they're in a nappy/diaper again and they might have some accidents.) We would recommend having a waterproof mattress cover on your child's bed.\"},{\"p\":\"If you are in the second group and your child has started waking more at night because they need to wee, it will take a little more effort to night train them. The method is similar to dream feeding a baby, however you are "dream pottying" your child – taking them wees in the night without them really fully waking. Still explain to your child that they don't need night underwear anymore and also reinforce that it's ok for them to wake and go wees in the potty/toilet during the night. Sometimes just explaining this is enough for them to night train!\"},{\"p\":\"To "dream-potty" your child, just before you go to bed take the potty into their room, get them gently out of their bed and sit them on the potty. Tell them to go wees (you might need to repeat this a few times). Be patient. After they go put them back in bed. Repeat this for a few nights until they either refuse to go, or the quantity of their wee is much reduced, or they are confident waking on their own for a wee. They are learning to control their bladder at night by learning to wake to go to the toilet. It does help to vary the times you get them up as they may start to develop a habit of needing to wee at that time if it continues for an extended period. Most children will, after a couple of nights, simply refuse to go when you wake them, however justgetting them used to the idea of waking at night if they need to wee will generally ensure they start sleeping a lot better.\"},{\"p\":\"There may be a few bed wettings, but if your child is good and ready to night train you might not encounter any at all. Make sure you praise them and reinforce their good night toileting habits in the morning.\"},{\"p\":\"If a week has passed of you getting them up in the night and they are still weeing good quantities during the night, firstly limit their fluid intake significantly before bed. If they are still weeing a lot they might not be quite ready to night train yet. You are better to wait until they have had 2 weeks of consistently dry nappies/diapers in the morning.\"},{\"p\":\"Always make sure your child goes wees as soon as they wake in the morning and keep reinforcing their amazing efforts!\"},{\"p\":\"\"},{\"blockquote\":\"If your child is still having milk at bedtime, you will need to hold off the night training until they are no longer having this  fluid right before bed; giving them a lot of liquid at bedtime is going to sabotage any night training attempts!\"}]}",
